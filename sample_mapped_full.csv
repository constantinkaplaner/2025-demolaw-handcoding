THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 of 29 October 1975 fixing criteria for the mobilization of cereals intended as food aid (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 (4), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;
Whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1974/80 of 22 July 1980 laying down general implementing rules in respect of certain food-aid operations involving cereals and rice (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3323/81 (9), should be applied as far as possible, particularly in respect of the procedure for submission of tenders, since the manner in which the security is lodged must guarantee that the successful tenderer complies with his obligations;
Whereas, however, the specific provisions concerning delivery to destination must be set out; whereas the successful tenderer must thus bear all risk in the goods up to unloading at the stipulated destination; whereas payment can be made only when proof of delivery to the destination is provided;
Whereas it must be made clear who is to bear any costs which arise in the event that for reasons of force majeure the operation in question is not completed within the period stipulated;
Whereas the Dutch intervention agency should be made responsible for the tendering procedure in question;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. The intervention agency mentioned in Annex I hereto is hereby required to implement the mobilization and supply of the product stated in the said Annex as food aid, subject to the provisions of this Regulation.
2. Supply of the products shall be organized under the tendering procedure.
3. Annex I shall take the place of a notice of invitation to tender. The intervention agency responsible shall make further publications as necessary.
Article 2
1. For the purposes of the invitation to tender, the following provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1974/80 shall apply:
— Article 4, except the provisions of paragraph 3 (e) and paragraph 4 (d) and (e), in respect of submission of tenders,
— Article 5 in respect of provision of security,
— Article 6 in respect of opening and reading tenders,
— Article 8 in respect of comparing tenders.

The tender shall state separately the amount of cost in respect of sea and land transport to the stipulated final destination.
The tender shall indicate the Member State in which the tenderer, in the event of his being declared successful, undertakes to complete the customs export formalities.
3. The tenderer shall carry out his obligations pursuant to this Regulation and the undertakings referred to in Article 4 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1974/80, with the exception of subparagraphs (d) and (e) thereof.
4. The tenderer shall undertake to ship in vessels listed in the larger classes in recognized classification registers, not more than 15 years old, and attested by a competent body as meeting hygiene requirements.
Article 3
1. Without prejudice to paragraphs 2 and 3, the contract shall be awarded within 48 hours to the tenderer who has submitted the most favourable tender.
2. Where the most favourable tender is submitted by more than one tenderer, the intervention agency shall award the contract to one of those tenderers by drawing lots.
3. If the tenders do not appear to be in line with the prices normally prevailing on the market, the intervention agency may, with the agreement of the Commission, decide not to award the contract.
4. The intervention agency shall communicate the results of the tendering procedure to all the tenderers by letter or telex sent not later than the first working day following the award decision.
Article 4
1. The successful tenderer shall contract as necessary, at his own expense, for carriage of the goods to the final destination and shall bear all the costs involved, including those of unloading and warehousing at the destination. He shall take out suitable insurance.
2. The successful tenderer shall bear all the risks relating to the goods, in particular of loss or deterioration to which the goods are subject, until they have effectively been unloaded and delivered to the final destination.
3. The successful tenderer shall communicate as soon as possible to the recipient's representative the date of loading, the means of transport used to consign the goods to the final destination, and the probable date of arrival. He shall immediately send this information to the intervention agency responsible for payment, which shall forward it without delay to the Commission.
The tenderer shall advise the recipient's representative, at least three days in advance, of the probable date of arrival of the goods at the final destination.
Article 5
1. The intervention agency of the country of shipment shall arrange for a check at the port before loading on the quantity, quality and packaging of the goods. Following inspection an attestation shall be issued by the intervention agency. The costs relating thereto shall be borne by the successful tenderer.
The successful tenderer shall provide that intervention agency with a certificate from the organization which undertook fumigation, showing that that operation has been carried out.
2. Samples intended for analysis shall be taken and the inspection shall be carried out in accordance with the trade practices in force in the country of shipment. The successful tenderer and the recipient's representative shall be invited to take part in the operation.
Two sealed samples shall be kept by the intervention agency until issue by the recipient of the taking-over certificate or until issue of the certificate referred to in Article 6 (2).
3. If the inspection referred to in paragraph 1 gives rise to a dispute, the intervention agency shall arrange for a second inspection by a service different from that mentioned in paragraph 1, the findings of which shall be final. The costs relating thereto shall be borne by the losing party.
4. Where the inspection provided for in the preceding paragraphs reveals that the goods do not satisfy the requirements stipulated, they must be refused and replaced. Where some quantities are missing the successful tenderer must make up the cargo.
Article 6
1. A taking-over certificate shall be issued by the recipient immediately following unloading at the final destination. It shall state the place and date of taking over and give a description of the goods taken over in the form given in Annex II and any comments by the recipient.
2. Where the taking-over certificate is not issued for reasons other than a dispute about the goods, proof of delivery may be provided by means of a certificate of the form given in Annex II endorsed by the Community representative in the country of destination.
Article 7
1. Payment to the successful tenderer shall be made by the intervention agency of the Member State in which the customs export formalities are completed.
2. The amount to be paid shall be that of the tender plus, where appropriate, the costs referred to in Article 9. It shall be paid in the currency of the Member State which is responsible for payment. For this purpose this amount shall be converted by using,
— where the currencies in question are maintained within a maximum spread at any one time of 2.25%, the conversion rate resulting from their central rate,
— in other cases, the relationship between the two currencies concerned established by using the latest statement of their spot exchange rates made immediately prior to the closing date for the submission of tenders as published in the 'C' series of the Official Journal of the European Communities.
3. The amount referred to in paragraph 2 shall be paid to the successful tenderer on presentation of the original of the taking-over certificate or a certified copy thereof, or, if this is not available, of the certificate referred to in Article 6 (2).

2. The security referred to in Article 7 (4) shall be released immediately when the successful tenderer furnishes the proof in accordance with Article 6 that at least 80% of the quantity provided for has been delivered in conformity with the conditions laid down in this Regulation.

If the successful tenderer, for reasons of force majeure, has to bear exceptional costs in respect of the delivery made under this Regulation which cannot be covered by insurance, he may receive compensation therefor on production of supporting documents and with the prior agreement of the Commission.
Article 10
Except in case of force majeure the successful tenderer shall bear all the financial consequences of the non-delivery of the goods under the conditions laid down in this Regulation if the recipient had made delivery possible under such conditions.
The costs resulting from the non-delivery of the goods following a case of force majeure shall be borne by the intervention agency responsible for payment.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 of 29 October 1975 fixing criteria for the mobilization of cereals intended as food aid (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 (4), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;
Whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1974/80 of 22 July 1980 laying down general implementing rules in respect of certain food-aid operations involving cereals and rice (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3323/81 (9), should be applied as far as possible, particularly in respect of the procedure for submission of tenders, since the manner in which the security is lodged must guarantee that the successful tenderer complies with his obligations;
Whereas, however, the specific provisions concerning delivery to destination must be set out; whereas the successful tenderer must thus bear all risk in the goods up to unloading at the stipulated destination; whereas payment can be made only when proof of delivery to the destination is provided;
Whereas it must be made clear who is to bear any costs which arise in the event that for reasons of force majeure the operation in question is not completed within the period stipulated;
Whereas the Dutch intervention agency should be made responsible for the tendering procedure in question;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 of 29 October 1975 fixing criteria for the mobilization of cereals intended as food aid (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 (4), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;
Whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1974/80 of 22 July 1980 laying down general implementing rules in respect of certain food-aid operations involving cereals and rice (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3323/81 (9), should be applied as far as possible, particularly in respect of the procedure for submission of tenders, since the manner in which the security is lodged must guarantee that the successful tenderer complies with his obligations;
Whereas, however, the specific provisions concerning delivery to destination must be set out; whereas the successful tenderer must thus bear all risk in the goods up to unloading at the stipulated destination; whereas payment can be made only when proof of delivery to the destination is provided;
Whereas it must be made clear who is to bear any costs which arise in the event that for reasons of force majeure the operation in question is not completed within the period stipulated;
Whereas the Dutch intervention agency should be made responsible for the tendering procedure in question;

Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;

Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,

Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 of 29 October 1975 fixing criteria for the mobilization of cereals intended as food aid (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 (4), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 of 29 October 1975 fixing criteria for the mobilization of cereals intended as food aid (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 (4), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 of 29 October 1975 fixing criteria for the mobilization of cereals intended as food aid (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 (4), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 of 29 October 1975 fixing criteria for the mobilization of cereals intended as food aid (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 (4), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;
Whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1974/80 of 22 July 1980 laying down general implementing rules in respect of certain food-aid operations involving cereals and rice (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3323/81 (9), should be applied as far as possible, particularly in respect of the procedure for submission of tenders, since the manner in which the security is lodged must guarantee that the successful tenderer complies with his obligations;
Whereas, however, the specific provisions concerning delivery to destination must be set out; whereas the successful tenderer must thus bear all risk in the goods up to unloading at the stipulated destination; whereas payment can be made only when proof of delivery to the destination is provided;
Whereas it must be made clear who is to bear any costs which arise in the event that for reasons of force majeure the operation in question is not completed within the period stipulated;
Whereas the Dutch intervention agency should be made responsible for the tendering procedure in question;

Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;
Whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1974/80 of 22 July 1980 laying down general implementing rules in respect of certain food-aid operations involving cereals and rice (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3323/81 (9), should be applied as far as possible, particularly in respect of the procedure for submission of tenders, since the manner in which the security is lodged must guarantee that the successful tenderer complies with his obligations;
Whereas, however, the specific provisions concerning delivery to destination must be set out; whereas the successful tenderer must thus bear all risk in the goods up to unloading at the stipulated destination; whereas payment can be made only when proof of delivery to the destination is provided;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 of 29 October 1975 fixing criteria for the mobilization of cereals intended as food aid (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 (4), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;

Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 of 29 October 1975 fixing criteria for the mobilization of cereals intended as food aid (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 (4), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;

Whereas, however, the specific provisions concerning delivery to destination must be set out; whereas the successful tenderer must thus bear all risk in the goods up to unloading at the stipulated destination; whereas payment can be made only when proof of delivery to the destination is provided;
Whereas it must be made clear who is to bear any costs which arise in the event that for reasons of force majeure the operation in question is not completed within the period stipulated;
Whereas the Dutch intervention agency should be made responsible for the tendering procedure in question;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 of 29 October 1975 fixing criteria for the mobilization of cereals intended as food aid (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 (4), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;
Whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1974/80 of 22 July 1980 laying down general implementing rules in respect of certain food-aid operations involving cereals and rice (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3323/81 (9), should be applied as far as possible, particularly in respect of the procedure for submission of tenders, since the manner in which the security is lodged must guarantee that the successful tenderer complies with his obligations;
Whereas, however, the specific provisions concerning delivery to destination must be set out; whereas the successful tenderer must thus bear all risk in the goods up to unloading at the stipulated destination; whereas payment can be made only when proof of delivery to the destination is provided;
Whereas it must be made clear who is to bear any costs which arise in the event that for reasons of force majeure the operation in question is not completed within the period stipulated;
Whereas the Dutch intervention agency should be made responsible for the tendering procedure in question;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 of 29 October 1975 fixing criteria for the mobilization of cereals intended as food aid (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 (4), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1992/83 of 11 July 1983 laying down the implementing rules for 1983 for Regulation (EEC) No 3331/82 concerning food-aid policy and food-aid management (5),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;
Whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1974/80 of 22 July 1980 laying down general implementing rules in respect of certain food-aid operations involving cereals and rice (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3323/81 (9), should be applied as far as possible, particularly in respect of the procedure for submission of tenders, since the manner in which the security is lodged must guarantee that the successful tenderer complies with his obligations;
Whereas, however, the specific provisions concerning delivery to destination must be set out; whereas the successful tenderer must thus bear all risk in the goods up to unloading at the stipulated destination; whereas payment can be made only when proof of delivery to the destination is provided;
Whereas it must be made clear who is to bear any costs which arise in the event that for reasons of force majeure the operation in question is not completed within the period stipulated;
Whereas the Dutch intervention agency should be made responsible for the tendering procedure in question;

Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (7), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas on 29 July 1983 the Commission of the European Communities decided to grant, under a Community measure, 100 tonnes of cereals for the League of Red Cross Societies under the food-aid programme for 1983;
Whereas pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2750/75 the goods may be purchased anywhere on the Community market;
Whereas an invitation to tender should be issued for supply of the products delivered unloaded at Nyamirambo in view of the final use to be made of the goods delivered;

Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas the rules to be applied in calculating the variable component of the import levy on compound feedingstuffs are laid down in Article 14 (1) (A) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75; whereas Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2743/75 of 29 October 1975 on the system to be applied to cereal-based compound feedingstuffs (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2560/77 (4), provides that the incidence on the prime costs of these feedingstuffs of the levies applicable to their basic products should be calculated on the basis of the average of the levies applicable during the first 25 days of the month preceding that month of importation to the quantities of basic products considered to have been used in the manufacture of such compound feedingstuffs, this average being adjusted on the basis of the threshold price for the basic products in question ruling during the month of importation;
Whereas the 1985/86 marketing year for cereals other than durum wheat begins on 1 August 1985; whereas the Council has not, to date, adopted prices for these products for the 1985/86 marketing year; whereas the Commission, in compliance with the tasks entrusted to it by the Treaty, is obliged to adopt the precautionary measures essential to ensure continuity of operation of the common agricultural policy in the cereals sector;
Whereas, in order to ensure continuity of operation of the import arrangements for cereals, the prices set in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2124/85 (5), should be used for calculation of the levies on processed products; whereas these prices will be adjusted, beginning on 1 September 1985, by amounts equal to the monthly increases fixed by Regulation (EEC) No 1020/84;
Whereas the levy thus determined, increased by the fixed component, is valid for one month; whereas the amount of the fixed component of the levy is laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 2743/75;
Whereas, in order that account may be taken of the interests of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and of the overseas countries and territories, the levy relating to them in respect of certain products processed from cereals must be reduced by the amount of the fixed component and, in respect of some of these products, by part of the variable component; whereas this reduction must be made in accordance with Article 12 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 486/85 of 26 February 1985 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States or in the 'overseas countries and territories' (*), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2903/85 (6);
Whereas, if the levy system is to operate normally, levies should be calculated on the following basis:
— in the case of currencies which are maintained in relation to each other at any given moment within a band of 2.25%, a rate of exchange based on their central rate, multiplied by the coefficient provided for in Article 2b (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 974/71 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 855/84 (9),
— for other currencies, an exchange rate based on the arithmetic mean of the spot market rates of each of these currencies recorded over a given period in relation to the Community currencies referred to in the previous indent, and the aforesaid coefficient;

Whereas, in order that account may be taken of the interests of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and of the overseas countries and territories, the levy relating to them in respect of certain products processed from cereals must be reduced by the amount of the fixed component and, in respect of some of these products, by part of the variable component; whereas this reduction must be made in accordance with Article 12 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 486/85 of 26 February 1985 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States or in the 'overseas countries and territories' (*), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2903/85 (6);
Whereas, if the levy system is to operate normally, levies should be calculated on the following basis:
— in the case of currencies which are maintained in relation to each other at any given moment within a band of 2.25%, a rate of exchange based on their central rate, multiplied by the coefficient provided for in Article 2b (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 974/71 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 855/84 (9),
— for other currencies, an exchange rate based on the arithmetic mean of the spot market rates of each of these currencies recorded over a given period in relation to the Community currencies referred to in the previous indent, and the aforesaid coefficient;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 18 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75, the nomenclature provided for in this Regulation is incorporated in the Common Customs Tariff,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The import levies to be charged on the compound feedingstuffs covered by Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 and subject to Regulation (EEC) No 2743/75 shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.

Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

(b) for a quantity of wine subject to cotract to be determined and which is not the subject of the measure provided for in (a), conclude a storage contract subject to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 and in Article 10 of this Regulation for a period to be determined.
The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

(b) for a quantity of wine subject to cotract to be determined and which is not the subject of the measure provided for in (a), conclude a storage contract subject to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 and in Article 10 of this Regulation for a period to be determined.
The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

(b) for a quantity of wine subject to cotract to be determined and which is not the subject of the measure provided for in (a), conclude a storage contract subject to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 and in Article 10 of this Regulation for a period to be determined.
The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

(b) for a quantity of wine subject to cotract to be determined and which is not the subject of the measure provided for in (a), conclude a storage contract subject to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 and in Article 10 of this Regulation for a period to be determined.
The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.
Article 2
1. The period of three consecutive weeks referred to in Article 42 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall fall between 15 July and 30 November 1987.
2. Holders of long-term storage contracts for the types of table wine in respect of which the decision referred to in Article 1 (1) is adopted and for wines in close economic relationship with such wines may:
(a) for a quantity of wine not exceeding a percentage to be determined for the total quantity subject to contract of table wine which they have produced during the 1986/87 wine year, undertake distillation under the conditions laid down in Articles 3 to 10;
(b) for a quantity of wine subject to cotract to be determined and which is not the subject of the measure provided for in (a), conclude a storage contract subject to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 and in Article 10 of this Regulation for a period to be determined.
The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).
However, Member States may authorize approval of the contracts or delivery declarations referred to in Article 4 before producers have submitted the evidence referred to in the first subparagraph on condition that such contracts or delivery declarations contain a declaration by the producer by which he certifies that he has complied with the obligations referred to in the first subparagraph or is in the situation referred to in Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 and that he undertakes to deliver the residual quantities necessary in order to comply fully with his obligations within the period fixed by the competent national authority.

(b) for a quantity of wine subject to cotract to be determined and which is not the subject of the measure provided for in (a), conclude a storage contract subject to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 and in Article 10 of this Regulation for a period to be determined.
The measures referred to in the first subparagraph may apply only to wines for which a long-term storage contract has been concluded as referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86. Such wines must possess the characteristics required under that Regulation save as regards their volitile acidity which may not exceed the limit laid down in Article 66 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87.
3. The total quantity of table wine to which the percentage referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 applies shall be, in the case of each producer, the sum of the quantities stated in his production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration and the quantities produced by him after the date on which the production declaration provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 was submitted which are entered in the records referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75.
4. Other additional measures reserved for holders of storage contracts referred to in paragraph 2 (b) for a wine or type of wine in close economic relationship with that type of wine may be taken if that type has remained at a price lower than the activating price during the period between adoption of the decision referred to in Article 42 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and 15 January 1988.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014

COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. Where a decision is taken to implement the supplementary measures reserved for holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine for the 1986/87 wine year provided for in Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, such implementation shall be governed by the provisions of this Regulation.
2. In accordance with Article 47 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, producers who, during the 1986/87 wine year, were subject to the obligations referred to in Articles 35, 36 or 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 shall not be entitled to benefit from the measures provided for in this Regulation unless they provide proper evidence that they have complied with their obligations during the reference periods fixed respectively in Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2672/86 (7), Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2705/86 (8), and Article 22 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 854/86 (9).

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2710/87 of 9 September 1987 laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
Official Journal L 260 , 10/09/1987 P. 0009 - 0014
*****
COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2710/87
of 9 September 1987
laying down for the 1986/87 wine year detailed rules for the application of the additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts for table wine
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 42 (6) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2594/87 (6),
Whereas the measures employed to support the wine market have not fully yielded the desired results; whereas, in particular, the representative prices for table wines of types A I, R I and R II have remained lower than the respective activating prices since the beginning of the wine year; whereas, therefore, the first condition required under Article 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for the adoption of additional measures applicable to holders of long-term storage contracts is satisfied; whereas the second condition, namely that the representative price should remain lower than the activating price for three consecutive weeks, is likely to be fulfilled for table wines of types A I, R I and R II during the reference period;
Whereas during the storage period there is a natural alteration in the volatile acidity of the wine which might exceed the limit provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3950/86 of 23 December 1986 authorizing the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for certain table wines for the 1986/87 wine year (7), which was laid down with a storage period of nine months in view; whereas it seems appropriate to permit that the wine should be considered to have fulfilled the required conditions even if the volatile acidity content is higher than that laid down by the said Regulation, provided that the limit laid down for table wine of the type in question has not been exceeded and that all other administrative and technical conditions are complied with;
Whereas these measures should make provision for removing from the market by distillation a quantity of wine and for delaying for several months the marketing of the remaining quantity held by holders of long-term storage contracts, in anticipation of a recovery of the market; whereas, however, this latter measure might not achieve the desired objective; whereas provision for any further measures which may be necessary should therefore be made;
Whereas Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 that only producers who have satisfied the obligations laid down in Article 35 and, where appropriate, Articles 36 and 39 of that Regulation during a reference period to be determined may qualify for the intervention measures; whereas that period must therefore be specified; whereas, in certain cases, such proof can only be furnished at a date falling after the activation of these measures and whereas this provision therefore threatens to delay their implementation; whereas, for this reason, the Member States should be empowered to authorize access to the said measures at an earlier date; whereas this facility should be subject to conditions ensuring that producers who have not complied with the said obligations are excluded from the measures in question;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 42 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the distillation provided for by this Regulation may not exceed 18 % of the total quantity of table wine produced by each holder in the marketing year in which the long-term contract was concluded; whereas the quantity of table wine produced to which the said percentage is applied should be that shown in the production declaration provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2102/84 of 13 July 1984 on harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2528/87 (9), as in the records provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 of 30 April 1975 prescribing the form of
accompanying documents for wine products and specifying the obligations of wine producers and traders other than retailers (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (2);
Whereas the distillation provided for by this Regulation should take place in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83 of 25 July 1983 laying down general rules for distillation operations involving wine and the by-products of wine-making (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4); whereas, pursuant to Articles 4, 5 and 26 of that Regulation, time limits should be fixed for the submission of applications for approval of delivery contracts and declarations, for approval by the intervention agencies and for the distillation operations; whereas Article 8 of that Regulation specifies that the amount of the aid to be paid is to be fixed using the criteria set out therein;
Whereas additional information which must appear in the delivery contract and in the delcaration should also be specified;
Whereas, for wine obtained from grapes produced in Spain, a price must be fixed taking account of the level of guide prices in that Member State;
Whereas some of the wines delivered for distillation under this Regulation may be fortified for distillation; whereas the provisions applicable to distillation operations should therefore be adjusted in conformity with the rules laid down in Article 25 and 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83;
Whereas the intervention agencies and the Commission should be informed of the progress of distillation operations and should in particular be aware of the quantities of wine distilled and the quantities of alcohol obtained;
Whereas storage contracts must be concluded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 of 29 April 1983 on storage contracts for table wine, grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3949/86 (6); whereas in order to take account of market trends, provision should be made for terminating contracts;
Whereas, since the storage contracts referred to in this Regulation were concluded during the 1986/87 wine year, the last representative rate applicable during the said wine year should be used;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3814/92, and in particular point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 19 (4) thereof,
Whereas Article 19 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 (1) (a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 766/68 of 18 June 1968 laying down general rules for granting export refunds on sugar, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1489/76, provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 3 of that Regulation; whereas the same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account;
Whereas the refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality; whereas the latter is defined in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 431/68 of 9 April 1968 determining the standard quality for raw sugar and fixing the Community frontier crossing point for calculating cif prices for sugar; whereas, furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 766/68; whereas candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 394/70 of 2 March 1970 on detailed rules for granting export refunds on sugar, as last amended by Regulation (EEC);
Whereas the refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1% of the said content;
Whereas the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination;
Whereas, in special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1432/92, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3534/92, prohibits trade between the Community and the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro; whereas this prohibition does not apply to certain situations as given in the limitative enumeration laid down in Articles 2 and 3; whereas this should be taken into account when refunds are fixed;

Whereas the refund must be fixed every two weeks; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period;
Whereas it follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto;

COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 915/95 of 21 April 1995 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain fishery products (1995)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Community supplies of certain species of fish or fish fillets currently depend on imports from third countries; whereas it is in the Community's interests to suspend in part or in whole the customs duties for the products in question, within Community tariff quotas of an appropriate volume; whereas, in order not to jeopardize the development prospects of this production in the Community and to ensure an adequate supply to satisfy user industries, it is advisable to open those quotas for the period from 1 April to 30 June 1995, applying customs duties varied accordingly to sensitivity of the different products on the Community market;
Whereas it is necessary, in particular, to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the said quotas and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up;
Whereas the decision for the opening of autonomous tariff quotas should be taken by the Community; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no reasonable obstacle to authorizing the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas, however, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. From 1 April to 30 June 1995, the customs duties applicable on importation to products listed in the Annex shall be suspended at the levels and within the limits of the Community tariff quota indicated for each product.

The drawing requests, with indication of the date of acceptance of the said entries, must be transmitted to the Commission without delay.
The drawings are granted by the Commission by reference to the date of acceptance of the entries for release for free circulation by the customs authorities of the Member States concerned to the extent that the available balance so permits.

Whereas the decision for the opening of autonomous tariff quotas should be taken by the Community; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no reasonable obstacle to authorizing the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas, however, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly,

Council Regulation (EC) No 915/95 of 21 April 1995 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain fishery products (1995)
Official Journal L 095 , 27/04/1995 P. 0001 - 0003
COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 915/95 of 21 April 1995 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain fishery products (1995)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Community supplies of certain species of fish or fish fillets currently depend on imports from third countries; whereas it is in the Community's interests to suspend in part or in whole the customs duties for the products in question, within Community tariff quotas of an appropriate volume; whereas, in order not to jeopardize the development prospects of this production in the Community and to ensure an adequate supply to satisfy user industries, it is advisable to open those quotas for the period from 1 April to 30 June 1995, applying customs duties varied accordingly to sensitivity of the different products on the Community market;
Whereas it is necessary, in particular, to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the said quotas and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up;
Whereas the decision for the opening of autonomous tariff quotas should be taken by the Community; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no reasonable obstacle to authorizing the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas, however, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. From 1 April to 30 June 1995, the customs duties applicable on importation to products listed in the Annex shall be suspended at the levels and within the limits of the Community tariff quota indicated for each product.
2. Imports of the products in question shall not be covered by the quotas referred to in paragraph 1 unless the free-at-frontier price, which is determined by the Member States in accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 of 17 December 1992 on the common organization of the market in fishery and aquaculture products (1), is at least equal to the reference price fixed, or to be fixed, by the Community for the products under consideration of the categories of the products concerned.
Article 2
The tariff quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be managed by the Commission, which may take all appropriate administrative measures in order to ensure effective administration thereof.
Article 3
If an importer presents in a Member State an entry for release for free circulation, including a request for preferential benefit for a product covered by this Regulation and if this entry for release is accepted by the customs authorities, the Member States concerned shall inform the Commission and draw an amount corresponding to its requirements from the corresponding quota amount.
The drawing requests, with indication of the date of acceptance of the said entries, must be transmitted to the Commission without delay.
The drawings are granted by the Commission by reference to the date of acceptance of the entries for release for free circulation by the customs authorities of the Member States concerned to the extent that the available balance so permits.
If a Member State does not use the quantities drawn it shall return them as soon as possible to the corresponding quota amount.
If the quantities requested are greater than the available balance of the quota amount, allocation shall be made on a pro rata basis with respect to the requests. Member States shall be informed by the Commission of the drawings made.
Article 4
Each Member State shall ensure that importers of the products concerned have equal and uninterrupted access to the quotas for such time as the residual balance of the quota volumes so permits.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 923/96, and in particular Article 13 (3) thereof,
Whereas Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund;
Whereas Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds;
Whereas, however, in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets, allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported;
Whereas the refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 990/93, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1380/95, prohibits trade between the European Community and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro); whereas this prohibition does not apply in certain situations as comprehensively listed in Articles 2, 4, 5 and 7 thereof and in Council Regulation (EC) No 462/96; whereas account should be taken of this fact when fixing the refunds;
Whereas the Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,
Whereas that calculation must also take account of the cereal products content; whereas in the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of 'cereal products', namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for 'other cereals', these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products; whereas a refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff;
Whereas furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export;
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The export refunds on the compound feedingstuffs covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and subject to Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.

Council Regulation (EC) No 880/2002
of 27 May 2002
amending Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000(1) dual-use items (including software and technology) must be subject to effective control when they are exported from the Community.
(2) Under Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000, an authorisation is required for intra-Community transfers of the dual-use items and technology listed in Annex IV to that Regulation. That Annex includes in particular items subject to control in the context of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the Wassenaar Arrangement.
(3) The political commitments made by the Member States in the context of the NSG or the Wassenaar Arrangement must be applied in strict compliance with the principles established by Community law, particularly the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. Both Treaties establish the principle of the free movement of goods within the Community, and dual-use items are subject to this principle.
(4) Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 constitutes an exception to the principle of the free movement within the Community of dual-use items. This exception arises from the political commitments made by the Member States and the sensitivity of the items concerned.
(5) Since some of the items are less sensitive in terms of proliferation, control of their transfer within the Community under Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 does not seem justified.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 is hereby amended as follows:

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1489/2006
of 9 October 2006
fixing the interest rates to be used for calculating the costs of financing intervention measures comprising buying-in, storage and disposal for the 2007 EAGF accounting year
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 of 2 August 1978 laying down general rules for the financing of interventions by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section
(
1
)
, and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Under Article 3(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy
(
2
)
, intervention measures to regulate agricultural markets are financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF).
(2)
Article 4(1)(a) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the financing by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) of intervention measures in the form of public storage operations and the accounting of public storage operations by the paying agencies of the Member States
(
3
)
provides that expenditure relating to the financial costs incurred by Member States in mobilising funds to buy in products is to be determined in accordance with the methods set out in Annex IV to that Regulation on the basis of a uniform interest rate for the Community.
(3)
The uniform interest rate for the Community is the average of the three-month and 12-month forward Euribor rates recorded in the six months preceding the notification from the Member States provided for in point I.2 of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 884/2006, with a weighting of one third and two thirds respectively. That rate must be fixed at the beginning of each accounting year of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF).
(4)
However, if the interest rate notified by a Member State is lower than the uniform interest rate fixed for the Community, in accordance with the second subparagraph of point I.2 of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 a specific interest rate is fixed for that Member State. Also, in the absence of any notification from a Member State of the average rate of its interest costs by the end of the year, the Commission fixes the interest rate for that Member State at the level of the uniform rate fixed for the Community.
(5)
Given the Member States’ notifications to the Commission, the interest rates applicable for the 2007 EAGF accounting year should be fixed taking the various factors into account.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 639/2008
of 24 June 2008
amending Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products
(
1
)
, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Recent reductions in export refund rates, due to the combined effects of the reform of the common agricultural policy and of the movements in agricultural commodity prices on the world market, have led to reduced levels of applications for refund certificates, consequently easing the pressure on the Community budget for export refunds on goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty. In those circumstances where the Community is not in danger of breaching its international commitments, it is appropriate to simplify the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, therefore reducing the administrative burden on operators exporting those goods.
(2)
Pursuant to Article 27(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005
(
2
)
rights deriving from refund certificates may be transferred under certain conditions. In order to ensure consistency in the treatment of licences and certificates the procedure for those transfers should, where possible be aligned with the provisions relating to transfers of rights deriving from licences or certificates laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products
(
3
)
.
(3)
Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down the period within which the authority responsible for payment has to record the amounts of export refunds requested on the refund certificate. However, in view of the time required to process documentation in respect of export refunds differentiated by destination, this period may not be sufficient and should therefore be extended.
(4)
Article 38a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down the conditions for the notification of applications to the Commission by the Member States and the subsequent issue of refund certificates. Since more efficient reporting and communication systems have been introduced the time-limits concerned should be adjusted.
(5)
Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides for a system of tranches for issuing refund certificates. The period of validity applicable to those refund certificates is laid down in
Article 39 of that Regulation. To facilitate the operation of the system of refund certificates the period of validity of certificates issued under the first tranche and certificates applied for pursuant to Article 38a should be extended.
(6)
In order to be able to benefit from a reduction of the amount of security to be forfeited,
Article 45(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that unused certificates or extracts of certificates must be returned to the issuing authorities not later than 30 June of the budget period, in respect of which the certificates or extracts have been issued. The introduction of more efficient reporting systems allows this deadline to be extended.
(7)
Article 47 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down specific conditions under which small exporters may be granted export refunds. In the interest of simplification small exporters should be entitled to use refund certificates without losing the status of small exporter and, in addition, the payment threshold should be raised.
(8)
In order to have the measures provided for in this Regulation operational in due time the date of its entry into force should be on the day following publication in the
Official Journal of the European Union
.
(9)
Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10)
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 is amended as follows:

In such cases, one of the entries set out in Annex VIII shall be made by the issuing authority in box 6 of the certificate.’
2.
In Article 32(2), the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:
‘The authority responsible for payment shall record that amount on the refund certificate within six months of the date of receipt of the specific application.’

4.
In Article 39, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
‘2.   Subject to the second and the third subparagraph, refund certificates shall be valid until the last day of the fifth month following the month in which the application for the certificate was made, or, until the last day of the budget period, whichever is the earlier.
Refund certificates applied for in compliance with point (a) of Article 33 or Article 38a, at the latest on 7 November, shall be valid until the last day of the tenth month following the month in which the application for the certificate was made.
The refund certificates referred to in Article 40 shall be valid until the last day of the fifth month following the month in which the application for the certificate was made.
If refund rates are fixed in advance in accordance with Article 29, those rates shall remain valid until the last day of the period of validity of the certificate.’
5.
In Article 45, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:

6.
In Article 47(2), the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:
‘2.   Article 46 shall apply to exports for which the applications submitted by the operator on the terms set out in Article 32(1) during the budget year, including the submission of the application for the export in question, shall not give rise to payment of more than EUR 100 000.’
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 639/2008
of 24 June 2008
amending Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products
(
1
)
, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Recent reductions in export refund rates, due to the combined effects of the reform of the common agricultural policy and of the movements in agricultural commodity prices on the world market, have led to reduced levels of applications for refund certificates, consequently easing the pressure on the Community budget for export refunds on goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty. In those circumstances where the Community is not in danger of breaching its international commitments, it is appropriate to simplify the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, therefore reducing the administrative burden on operators exporting those goods.
(2)
Pursuant to Article 27(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005
(
2
)
rights deriving from refund certificates may be transferred under certain conditions. In order to ensure consistency in the treatment of licences and certificates the procedure for those transfers should, where possible be aligned with the provisions relating to transfers of rights deriving from licences or certificates laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products
(
3
)
.
(3)
Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down the period within which the authority responsible for payment has to record the amounts of export refunds requested on the refund certificate. However, in view of the time required to process documentation in respect of export refunds differentiated by destination, this period may not be sufficient and should therefore be extended.
(4)
Article 38a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down the conditions for the notification of applications to the Commission by the Member States and the subsequent issue of refund certificates. Since more efficient reporting and communication systems have been introduced the time-limits concerned should be adjusted.
(5)
Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides for a system of tranches for issuing refund certificates. The period of validity applicable to those refund certificates is laid down in
Article 39 of that Regulation. To facilitate the operation of the system of refund certificates the period of validity of certificates issued under the first tranche and certificates applied for pursuant to Article 38a should be extended.
(6)
In order to be able to benefit from a reduction of the amount of security to be forfeited,
Article 45(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that unused certificates or extracts of certificates must be returned to the issuing authorities not later than 30 June of the budget period, in respect of which the certificates or extracts have been issued. The introduction of more efficient reporting systems allows this deadline to be extended.
(7)
Article 47 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down specific conditions under which small exporters may be granted export refunds. In the interest of simplification small exporters should be entitled to use refund certificates without losing the status of small exporter and, in addition, the payment threshold should be raised.
(8)
In order to have the measures provided for in this Regulation operational in due time the date of its entry into force should be on the day following publication in the
Official Journal of the European Union
.
(9)
Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10)
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 is amended as follows:

1.   Obligations deriving from certificates shall not be transferable.

Such transfer shall relate to the amounts not yet attributed to the certificate or extract.
2.   Transferees may not further transfer their rights but may transfer them back to the titular holder. Transfers back to the titular holder shall relate to quantities not yet attributed to the certificate or extract.
In such cases, one of the entries set out in Annex VIII shall be made by the issuing authority in box 6 of the certificate.’
2.
In Article 32(2), the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:
‘The authority responsible for payment shall record that amount on the refund certificate within six months of the date of receipt of the specific application.’
3.
In Article 38a, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
‘2.   Applications lodged in the course of each week shall be notified by Member States to the Commission on the following Monday. The corresponding certificates may be issued from the Wednesday following the notification, unless the Commission issues instructions to the contrary.’
4.
In Article 39, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
‘2.   Subject to the second and the third subparagraph, refund certificates shall be valid until the last day of the fifth month following the month in which the application for the certificate was made, or, until the last day of the budget period, whichever is the earlier.
Refund certificates applied for in compliance with point (a) of Article 33 or Article 38a, at the latest on 7 November, shall be valid until the last day of the tenth month following the month in which the application for the certificate was made.
The refund certificates referred to in Article 40 shall be valid until the last day of the fifth month following the month in which the application for the certificate was made.
If refund rates are fixed in advance in accordance with Article 29, those rates shall remain valid until the last day of the period of validity of the certificate.’

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 639/2008
of 24 June 2008
amending Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products
(
1
)
, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Recent reductions in export refund rates, due to the combined effects of the reform of the common agricultural policy and of the movements in agricultural commodity prices on the world market, have led to reduced levels of applications for refund certificates, consequently easing the pressure on the Community budget for export refunds on goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty. In those circumstances where the Community is not in danger of breaching its international commitments, it is appropriate to simplify the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, therefore reducing the administrative burden on operators exporting those goods.
(2)
Pursuant to Article 27(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005
(
2
)
rights deriving from refund certificates may be transferred under certain conditions. In order to ensure consistency in the treatment of licences and certificates the procedure for those transfers should, where possible be aligned with the provisions relating to transfers of rights deriving from licences or certificates laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products
(

)
.
(3)
Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down the period within which the authority responsible for payment has to record the amounts of export refunds requested on the refund certificate. However, in view of the time required to process documentation in respect of export refunds differentiated by destination, this period may not be sufficient and should therefore be extended.
(4)
Article 38a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down the conditions for the notification of applications to the Commission by the Member States and the subsequent issue of refund certificates. Since more efficient reporting and communication systems have been introduced the time-limits concerned should be adjusted.
(5)
Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides for a system of tranches for issuing refund certificates. The period of validity applicable to those refund certificates is laid down in
Article 39 of that Regulation. To facilitate the operation of the system of refund certificates the period of validity of certificates issued under the first tranche and certificates applied for pursuant to Article 38a should be extended.
(6)
In order to be able to benefit from a reduction of the amount of security to be forfeited,
Article 45(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that unused certificates or extracts of certificates must be returned to the issuing authorities not later than 30 June of the budget period, in respect of which the certificates or extracts have been issued.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products
(
1
)
, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Recent reductions in export refund rates, due to the combined effects of the reform of the common agricultural policy and of the movements in agricultural commodity prices on the world market, have led to reduced levels of applications for refund certificates, consequently easing the pressure on the Community budget for export refunds on goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty. In those circumstances where the Community is not in danger of breaching its international commitments, it is appropriate to simplify the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, therefore reducing the administrative burden on operators exporting those goods.
(2)
Pursuant to Article 27(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005
(
2
)
rights deriving from refund certificates may be transferred under certain conditions. In order to ensure consistency in the treatment of licences and certificates the procedure for those transfers should, where possible be aligned with the provisions relating to transfers of rights deriving from licences or certificates laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products
(

)
.
(3)
Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down the period within which the authority responsible for payment has to record the amounts of export refunds requested on the refund certificate. However, in view of the time required to process documentation in respect of export refunds differentiated by destination, this period may not be sufficient and should therefore be extended.
(4)
Article 38a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down the conditions for the notification of applications to the Commission by the Member States and the subsequent issue of refund certificates. Since more efficient reporting and communication systems have been introduced the time-limits concerned should be adjusted.
(5)
Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides for a system of tranches for issuing refund certificates. The period of validity applicable to those refund certificates is laid down in
Article 39 of that Regulation. To facilitate the operation of the system of refund certificates the period of validity of certificates issued under the first tranche and certificates applied for pursuant to Article 38a should be extended.
(6)
In order to be able to benefit from a reduction of the amount of security to be forfeited,
Article 45(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that unused certificates or extracts of certificates must be returned to the issuing authorities not later than 30 June of the budget period, in respect of which the certificates or extracts have been issued. The introduction of more efficient reporting systems allows this deadline to be extended.
(7)
Article 47 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down specific conditions under which small exporters may be granted export refunds. In the interest of simplification small exporters should be entitled to use refund certificates without losing the status of small exporter and, in addition, the payment threshold should be raised.
(8)
In order to have the measures provided for in this Regulation operational in due time the date of its entry into force should be on the day following publication in the
Official Journal of the European Union
.
(9)
Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10)
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 639/2008
of 24 June 2008
amending Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products
(
1
)
, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Recent reductions in export refund rates, due to the combined effects of the reform of the common agricultural policy and of the movements in agricultural commodity prices on the world market, have led to reduced levels of applications for refund certificates, consequently easing the pressure on the Community budget for export refunds on goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty. In those circumstances where the Community is not in danger of breaching its international commitments, it is appropriate to simplify the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, therefore reducing the administrative burden on operators exporting those goods.
(2)
Pursuant to Article 27(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005
(
2
)
rights deriving from refund certificates may be transferred under certain conditions. In order to ensure consistency in the treatment of licences and certificates the procedure for those transfers should, where possible be aligned with the provisions relating to transfers of rights deriving from licences or certificates laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products
(
3
)
.
(3)
Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down the period within which the authority responsible for payment has to record the amounts of export refunds requested on the refund certificate. However, in view of the time required to process documentation in respect of export refunds differentiated by destination, this period may not be sufficient and should therefore be extended.
(4)
Article 38a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down the conditions for the notification of applications to the Commission by the Member States and the subsequent issue of refund certificates. Since more efficient reporting and communication systems have been introduced the time-limits concerned should be adjusted.
(5)
Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides for a system of tranches for issuing refund certificates. The period of validity applicable to those refund certificates is laid down in
Article 39 of that Regulation. To facilitate the operation of the system of refund certificates the period of validity of certificates issued under the first tranche and certificates applied for pursuant to Article 38a should be extended.
(6)
In order to be able to benefit from a reduction of the amount of security to be forfeited,
Article 45(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that unused certificates or extracts of certificates must be returned to the issuing authorities not later than 30 June of the budget period, in respect of which the certificates or extracts have been issued. The introduction of more efficient reporting systems allows this deadline to be extended.
(7)
Article 47 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 lays down specific conditions under which small exporters may be granted export refunds. In the interest of simplification small exporters should be entitled to use refund certificates without losing the status of small exporter and, in addition, the payment threshold should be raised.
(8)
In order to have the measures provided for in this Regulation operational in due time the date of its entry into force should be on the day following publication in the
Official Journal of the European Union
.
(9)
Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10)
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Such transfer shall relate to the amounts not yet attributed to the certificate or extract.
2.   Transferees may not further transfer their rights but may transfer them back to the titular holder. Transfers back to the titular holder shall relate to quantities not yet attributed to the certificate or extract.
In such cases, one of the entries set out in Annex VIII shall be made by the issuing authority in box 6 of the certificate.’
2.
In Article 32(2), the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:
‘The authority responsible for payment shall record that amount on the refund certificate within six months of the date of receipt of the specific application.’

4.
In Article 39, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
‘2.   Subject to the second and the third subparagraph, refund certificates shall be valid until the last day of the fifth month following the month in which the application for the certificate was made, or, until the last day of the budget period, whichever is the earlier.
Refund certificates applied for in compliance with point (a) of Article 33 or Article 38a, at the latest on 7 November, shall be valid until the last day of the tenth month following the month in which the application for the certificate was made.
The refund certificates referred to in Article 40 shall be valid until the last day of the fifth month following the month in which the application for the certificate was made.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 37 in conjunction with Article 31(1) thereof,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 209 and 212 in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and Article 218(8), second subparagraph, thereof,
Having regard to the joint proposal of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and of the European Commission,
Having regard to the consent of the European Parliament,

Hence, the rules and principles set out in the Treaty correspond to the objectives of the Union’s common foreign and security polity.
(3)
Furthermore, the Treaty provides for enhancing cooperation in economic, trade, social, technical and scientific fields as well as for the acceleration of economic growth in the region by promoting a greater utilisation of the agriculture and industries of the nations in Southeast Asia, the expansion of their trade and the improvement of their economic infrastructure. Therefore, the Treaty promotes cooperation with the developing countries of that region as well as economic, financial and technical cooperation with countries other than developing countries.
(4)
The Council, at its meeting of 4-5 December 2006, authorised the Presidency and the Commission to negotiate the Union’s and the European Community’s accession to the Treaty.
(5)
By letter dated 7 December 2006, the Union and the European Community informed Cambodia, in its capacity of ASEAN Coordinator for relations with the Union, of its decision to apply for accession to the Treaty subject to the understandings expressed in the letter.

On 28 May 2009, Thailand, then Chair of ASEAN, declared the consent of all the States in Southeast Asia to the accession to the Treaty by the Union and the European Community, subject to the entry into force of the Third Protocol to the Treaty.
(7)
The Third Protocol to the Treaty, signed on 23 July 2010, provides for the accession of regional organisations to the Treaty.
(8)
The Union should therefore accede to the Treaty following the entry into force of the Third Protocol to the Treaty,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
The accession of the Union to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia is hereby approved on behalf of the Union.
The texts of the Treaty and its three amending Protocols, as well as the Instrument of Accession to the Treaty by the Union, are attached to this Decision.
