"1","31970L0156","CHAPTER I DEFINITIONS Article 1 For the purposes of this Directive, ""vehicle"" means any motor vehicle intended for use on the road, with or without bodywork, having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h, and its trailers, with the exception of vehicles which run on rails and of agricultural tractors and machinery. Article 2 For the purposes of this Directive: (a) ""national type approval"" means the administrative procedure known as: - ""agrÃ ©ation par type"" and ""aanneming"" in Belgian law; - ""allgemeine Betriebserlaubnis"" in German law; - ""rÃ ©ception par type"" in French law; - ""omologazione"" or ""approvazione del tipo"" in Italian law; - ""agrÃ ©ation"" in Luxembourg law; - ""typegoedkeuring"" in Netherlands law; (b) ""EEC type-approval"" means the procedure whereby a Member State certifies that a vehicle type satisfies the technical requirements of the separate Directives and the checks listed in the EEC type-approval certificate, the model of which is given in Annex II. CHAPTER II EEC vehicle type-approval Article 3 Application for EEC type-approval shall be submitted by the manufacturer or his authorised representative to a Member State. An application shall be accompanied by an information document, the model of which is given in Annex I, and by the documents referred to therein. No application in respect of any one type of vehicle may be submitted to more than one Member State. Article 4 1. A Member State shall approve all vehicle types which satisfy the following conditions: (a) the vehicle type must conform to the particulars in the information document; (b) the vehicle type must satisfy the checks listed in the model, referred to in Article 2 (b), of the type approval certificate. 2. The Member State which has granted type approval shall take the necessary measures to verify, in so far as is necessary and if need be in co-operation with the competent authorities of the other Member States, that production models conform to the approved prototype. Such verification shall be limited to spot checks. Each Member State shall complete all the sections of a type approval certificate for each vehicle type which it approves. Article 5 1. The competent authorities of each Member State shall send within one month to the competent authorities of the other Member States a copy of the information document and approval certificate for each vehicle type which they approve or refuse to approve. 2. The manufacturer or his authorised representative in the country of registration shall complete a certificate of conformity, the model of which is given in Annex III, for each vehicle manufactured in conformity with the approved prototype. 3. Member States may, however, for purposes of taxation of a vehicle or completion of its registration documents, ask for particulars not mentioned in Annex III to be given on the certificate of conformity, provided that such particulars are explicitly stated on the information document or can be derived therefrom by a straightforward calculation. Article 6 1. The Member State which has granted EEC type-approval must take the necessary measures to ensure that it is informed of any cessation of production and of any change in particulars appearing in the information document. 2. If the State in question considers that such a change does not require an amendment to the existing type-approval certificate, or completion of a fresh type-approval certificate, the competent authorities of that State shall inform the manufacturer thereof and shall send the competent authorities of the other Member States, in periodic batches, copies of amendments to information documents which have already been distributed. 3. If the State in question finds that an amendment to an information document warrants fresh checks or fresh tests and that it is accordingly necessary to amend the existing type-approval certificate or complete a fresh type-approval certificate, the competent authorities of that State shall inform the manufacturer thereof and shall, within one month of such fresh documents being completed, send them to the competent authorities of the other Member States. 4. Where a type-approval certificate is amended or replaced, or is no longer valid because the type to which it relates has been taken out of production, the competent authorities of the Member State which granted that type approval shall, within one month, communicate to the competent authorities of the other Member States the serial numbers of the last vehicle produced in conformity with the old certificate and, where applicable, the serial numbers of the first vehicle produced in conformity with the fresh or amended certificate. Article 7 1. No Member State may refuse to register or prohibit the sale, entry into service or use of any new vehicle on grounds relating to its construction or functioning, where that vehicle is accompanied by a certificate of conformity. 2. Nevertheless, this certificate shall not prevent a Member State from taking such measures in respect of vehicles which do not conform to the approved prototype. There shall be failure to conform to the approved prototype where deviations from the particulars in the information document are found to exist and where these deviations have not been authorised under Article 6 (2) or (3) by the Member State which granted the type-approval. A vehicle shall not be considered to deviate from the approved type where tolerances are permitted by separate Directives and these tolerances are respected. Article 8 1. If the Member State which has granted EEC type-approval finds that a number of vehicles accompanied by a certificate of conformity do not conform to the type which it has approved, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that production models conform to the approved type. The competent authorities of that State shall advise those of the other Member States of the measures taken, which may, where necessary, extend to withdrawal of EEC type-approval. The said authorities shall take like measures if they are informed by the competent authorities of another Member State of such failure to conform. 2. The competent authorities of the Member States shall inform each other within one month of any withdrawal of EEC type-approval, and of the reasons for such measure. 3. If the Member State which has granted EEC type-approval disputes the failure to conform notified to it, the Member States concerned shall endeavour to settle the dispute. The Commission shall be kept informed and shall, where necessary, hold appropriate consultations for the purpose of reaching a settlement. Article 9 If a Member State finds that vehicles of a particular type are a hazard to road safety although they are accompanied by a properly issued certificate of conformity, then that State may, for a maximum period of six months, refuse to register such vehicles or prohibit their sale, entry into service or use in its territory. It shall forthwith inform the other Member States and Commission thereof, stating the reasons on which its decision is based. CHAPTER III Transitional provisions Article 10 1. Once this Directive has entered into force, and as the separate Directives necessary for the granting of EEC type-approval become applicable: - national type-approval shall be based on the harmonised technical requirements instead of on the corresponding national requirements, if the applicant so requests; - on application by a manufacturer or his authorised representative and on submission of the information document referred to in Article 3, the Member State concerned shall complete the sections of the type approval certificate referred to in Article 2 (b). A copy of this certificate shall be issued to the applicant. Other Member States to which application is made for national type-approval for the same type of vehicle shall accept this copy as proof that the requisite checks have been carried out. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be revoked once all the requirements necessary for the granting of EEC type-approval are applicable. CHAPTER IV General and final provisions Article 11 Any changes which are necessary in order to adapt: - Annexes I, II and III of this Directive, or - the provisions contained in the separate Directives referred to in Annex II and specified in each of those Directives, to take account of technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13.

The Council shall act by a qualified majority. (c) If, within three months of the proposal being submitted to it, the Council has not acted, the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Commission. Article 14 All decisions taken pursuant to the provisions adopted in implementation of this Directive and refusing or withdrawing type approval, or refusing registration or prohibiting sale or use, shall state in detail the reasons on which they are based. A decision shall be notified to the party concerned, who shall at the same time be informed of the remedies available to him under the laws in force in the Member States and of the time limits allowed for the exercise of such remedies. Article 15 1. Member States shall put into force provisions containing the requirements needed in order to comply with this Directive within eighteen months of its notification and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 2. Member States shall ensure that the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive are communicated to the Commission.

These subjects may cover both theoretical knowledge and practical skills required for the pursuit of the profession. This aptitude test must take account of the fact that the applicant is a qualified professional in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which he comes. It shall cover subjects to be selected from those on the list referred to in the second subparagraph, knowledge of which is essential to the pursuit of the profession in the host Member State. The test may also include knowledge of the professional rules applicable to the activities in question in the host Member State. The detailed application of the aptitude test shall be determined by the competent authorities of that State.

This Directive shall apply to neither professions which are the subject of a specific Directive establishing arrangements for the mutual recognition of diplomas by Member States, nor activities covered by a Directive listed in Annex A. The Directives listed in Annex B shall be made applicable to the pursuit as an employed person of the activities covered by those Directives. CHAPTER III System for recognition where a host Member State requires possession of a diploma within the meaning of this Directive or Directive 89/48/EEC Article 3 Without prejudice to Directive 89/48/EEC, where, in a host Member State, the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject to possession of a diploma, as defined in this Directive or in Directive 89/48/EEC, the competent authority may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to authorize a national of a Member State to take up or pursue that profession on the same conditions as those which apply to its own nationals: (a) if the applicant holds the diploma, as defined in this Directive or in Directive 89/48/EEC, required in another Member State for the taking up or pursuit of the profession in question in its territory, such diploma having been awarded in a Member State; or (b) if the applicant has pursued the profession in question full-time for two years, or for an equivalent period on a part-time basis, during the previous 10 years in another Member State which does not regulate that profession within the meaning of either Article 1 (e) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (f) of this Directive or Article 1 (c) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (d) of Directive 89/48/EEC, and possesses evidence of education and training which: - has been awarded by a competent authority in a Member State, designated in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of that State, and - either shows that the holder has successfully completed a post-secondary course, other than that referred to in the second indent of Article 1 (a) of Directive 89/48/EEC, of at least one year's duration, or of equivalent duration on a part-time basis, one of the conditions of entry of which is, as a general rule, the successful completion of the secondary course required to obtain entry to university or higher education, as well as any professional training which is an integral part of that post-secondary course, - or attests to regulated education and training referred to in Annex D, and - has prepared the holder for the pursuit of his profession. However, the two years' professional experience referred to above may not be required where the evidence of education and training held by the applicant and referred to in this point is awarded on completion of regulated education and training. The following shall be treated in the same way as the evidence of education and training referred to in the first subparagraph of this point: any evidence of education and training or any set of such evidence awarded by a competent authority in a Member State if it is awarded on the completion of education and training received in the Community and is recognized by that Member State as being of an equivalent level, provided that the other Member States and the Commission have been notified of this recognition. By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this Article, the host Member State is not required to apply this Article where the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject in its country to possession of a diploma as defined in Directive 89/48/EEC, one of the conditions for the issue of which shall be the completion of a post-secondary course of more than four years duration. Article 4 1. Notwithstanding Article 3, the host Member State may also require the applicant: (a) to provide evidence of professional experience, where the duration of the education and training adduced in support of his application, as laid down in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3, is at least one year less than that required in the host Member State. In this event, the period of professional experience required may not exceed: - twice the shortfall in duration of education and training where the shortfall relates to a post-secondary course and/or to a period of probationary practice carried out under the control of a supervising professional person and ending with an examination, - the shortfall where the shortfall relates to professional practice acquired with the assistance of a qualified member of the profession concerned. In the case of diplomas within the meaning of the second subparagraph of Article 1 (a), the duration of education and training recognized as being of an equivalent level shall be determined as for the education and training defined in the first subparagraph of Article 1 (a). When these provisions are applied, account must be taken of the professional experience referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3. In any event, the professional experience required may not exceed four years. Professional experience may not, however, be required of an applicant holding a diploma attesting to a post-secondary course as referred to in the second indent of Article 1 (a) or a diploma as defined in Article 1 (a) of Directive 89/48/EEC who wishes to pursue his profession in a host Member State which requires the possession of a diploma or evidence of education and training attesting to one of the courses of education and training as referred to in Annexes C and D; (b) to complete an adaptation period not exceeding three years or take an aptitude test where: - the theoretical and/or practical matters covered by the education and training which he has received as laid down in points (a) or (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3 differ substantially from those covered by the diploma, as defined in this Directive or in Directive 89/48/EEC, required in the host Member State, or - in the case referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 3, the profession regulated in the host Member State comprises one or more regulated professional activities which do not form part of the profession regulated in the Member State from which the applicant originates or comes and that difference corresponds to specific education and training required in the host Member State and covers theoretical and/or practical matters which differ substantially from those covered by the diploma, as defined in this Directive or in Directive 89/48/EEC, adduced by the applicant, or - in the case referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3, the profession regulated in the host Member State comprises one or more regulated professional activities which do not form part of the profession pursued by the applicant in the Member State from which he originates or comes, and that difference corresponds to specific education and training required in the host Member State and covers theoretical and/or practical matters which differ substantially from those covered by the evidence of education and training adduced by the applicant. Should the host Member State make use of this possibility, it must give the applicant the right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test. Where the host Member State, which requires a diploma as defined in Directive 89/48/EEC or in this Directive, intends to introduce derogations from an applicant's right to choose, the procedure laid down in Article 14 shall apply. By way of derogation from the second subparagraph of this point, the host Member State may reserve the right to choose between the adaptation period and the aptitude test if - a profession is involved the pursuit of which requires a precise knowledge of national law and in respect of which the provision of advice and/or assistance concerning national law is an essential and constant feature of the professional activity, or - where the host Member State makes access to the profession or its pursuit subject to the possession of a diploma as defined in Directive 89/48/EEC, one of the conditions for the award of which is the completion of a post-secondary course of at least three years' duration or an equivalent period on a part-time basis and the applicant holds either a diploma as defined in this Directive or evidence of education and training within the meaning of point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3 and not covered by Article 3 (b) of Directive 89/48/EEC. 2. However, the host Member State may not apply the provisions of paragraph 1 (a) and (b) cumulatively. CHAPTER IV System for recognition where a host Member State requires possession of a diploma and the applicant is the holder of a certificate or has received corresponding education and training Article 5 Where, in a host Member State, the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject to possession of a diploma, the competent authority may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to authorize a national of a Member State to take up or pursue that profession on the same conditions as those which apply to its own nationals: (a) if the applicant holds the certificate required in another Member State for the taking up or pursuit of the same profession in its territory, such certificate having been awarded in a Member State; or (b) if the applicant has pursued the same profession full-time for two years during the previous 10 years in another Member State which does not regulate that profession, within the meaning of Article 1 (e) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (f), and possesses evidence of education and training: - which was been awarded by a competent authority in a Member State, designated in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of that State, and - which shows that the holder, after having followed a secondary course, has completed: either a course of professional education or training other than courses referred to in point (a), provided at an educational or training establishment or on the job, or in combination at an educational or training establishment and on the job and complemented, where appropriate, by the probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that training course, or the probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that secondary course, or - which shows that the holder, after having followed a secondary course of a technical or vocational nature has completed, where necessary, either a course of professional education or training as referred to in the previous indent, or the period of probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that secondary course of a technical or vocational nature and - which has prepared the holder for the pursuit of this profession. However, the two years' professional experience referred to above may not be required where the evidence of education and training held by the applicant and referred to in this point is awarded on completion of regulated education and training. Nevertheless, the host Member State may require the applicant to undergo an adaptation period not exceeding three years or take an aptitude test. The host Member State must give the applicant the right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test. Where the host Member State intends to introduce derogations from an applicant's right to choose, the procedure laid down in Article 14 shall apply. CHAPTER V System for recognition where a host Member State requires possession of a certificate Article 6 Where, in the host Member State, the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject to possession of a certificate, the competent authority may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to authorize a national of a Member State to take up or pursue that profession on the same conditions as those which apply to its own nationals: (a) if the applicant holds the diploma, as defined in this Directive or in Directive 89/48/EEC, or the certificate required in another Member State for the taking up or pursuit of the profession in question in its territory, such diploma having been awarded in a Member State; or (b) if the applicant has pursued the profession in question full-time for two years or for an equivalent period on a part-time basis during the previous 10 years in another Member State which does not regulate that profession, within the meaning of Article 1 (e) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (f), and possesses evidence of education and training: - which has been awarded by a competent authority in a Member State, designated in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of that State, and - which shows that the holder has successfully completed a post-secondary course other than that referred to in the second indent of Article 1 (a) of Directive 89/48/EEC, of at least one year's duration or of equivalent duration on a part-time basis, one of the conditions of entry of which is, as a general rule, the completion of the secondary course required to obtain entry to university or higher education, as well as any professional training which is an integral part of that post-secondary course, or - which shows that the holder, after having followed a secondary course, has completed: either a course of education or training for a profession other than courses referred to in point (a), provided at an educational establishment or on the job, or in combination at an educational establishment and on the job and complemented, where appropriate, by the probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that training course, or the probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that secondary course, or - which shows that the holder, after having followed a secondary course of a technical or vocational nature has completed, where necessary, either a course of education or training for a profession as referred to in the previous indent, or the period of probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that secondary course of a technical or vocational nature and - which has prepared the holder for the pursuit of this profession. However, the two years' professional experience referred to above may not be required where the evidence of education and training held by the applicant and referred to in this point is awarded on completion or regulated education and training. (c) if the applicant who does not hold any diploma, certificate or other evidence of education and training within the meaning of Article 3 (b) or of point (b) of this Article has pursued the profession in question full-time for three consecutive years, or for an equivalent period on a part-time basis, during the previous 10 years in another Member State which does not regulate that profession within the meaning of Article 1 (e) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (f). The following shall be treated in the same way as the evidence of education and training referred to under (b) in the first subparagraph: any evidence of education and training or any set of such evidence awarded by a competent authority in a Member State if it is awarded on the completion of education and training received in the Community and is recognized by that Member State as being of an equivalent level, provided that the other Member States and the Commission have been notified of this recognition. Article 7 Without prejudice to Article 6, a host Member State may also require the applicant to: (a) complete an adaptation period not exceeding two years or to take an aptitude test when the education and training which he received in accordance with points (a) or (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 5 relates to theoretical or practical matters differing substantially from those covered by the certificate required in the host Member State, or where there are differences in the fields of activity characterized in the host Member State by specific education and training relating to theoretical or practical matters differing substantially from those covered by the applicant's evidence of formal qualifications. Should the host Member State make use of this possibility, it must give the applicant the right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test. Where the host Member State which requires a certificate intends to introduce derogations as regards an applicant's right to choose, the procedure laid down in Article 14 shall apply; (b) undergo an adaptation period not exceeding two years or take an aptitude test where, in the instance referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 6, he does not hold a diploma, certificate or other evidence of education and training. The host Member State may reserve the right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test. CHAPTER VI Special systems for recognition of other qualifications Article 8 Where, in the host Member State, the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject to possession of an attestation of competence, the competent authority may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to authorize a national of a Member State to take up or pursue that profession on the same conditions as those which apply to its own nationals: (a) if the applicant holds the attestation of competence required in another Member State for the taking up or pursuit of the same profession in its territory, such attestation having been awarded in a Member State; or (b) if the applicant provides proof of qualifications obtained in other Member States, and giving guarantees, in particular in the matter of health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, equivalent to those required by the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the host Member State. If the applicant does not provide proof of such an attestation or of such qualifications the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the host Member State shall apply. Article 9 Where, in the host Member State, the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject only to possession of evidence of education attesting to general education at primary or secondary school level, the competent authority may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to authorize a national of a Member State to take up or pursue that profession on the same conditions as those which apply to its own nationals if the applicant possesses formal qualifications of the corresponding level, awarded in another Member State. This evidence of formal qualifications must have been awarded by a competent authority in that Member State, designated in accordance with its own laws, regulations or administrative provisions. CHAPTER VII Other measures to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment, freedom to provide services and freedom of movement of employed persons Article 10 1. Where the competent authority of the host Member State requires of persons wishing to take up a regulated profession proof that they are of good character or repute or that they have not been declared bankrupt, or suspends or prohibits the pursuit of that profession in the event of serious professional misconduct or a criminal offence, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of Member States wishing to pursue that profession in its territory, the production of documents issued by competent authorities in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes showing that those requirements are met. Where the competent authorities of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes do not issue the documents referred to in the first subparagraph, such documents shall be replaced by a declaration on oath - or, in Member States where there is no provision for declaration on oath, by a solemn declaration - made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority or, where appropriate, a notary or qualified professional body of the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the person comes; such authority or notary shall issue written confirmation attesting the authenticity of the declaration on oath or solemn declaration. 2. Where the competent authority of the host Member State requires of nationals of that Member State wishing to take up or pursue a regulated profession a statement of physical of mental health, that authority shall accept as sufficient evidence in this respect the production of the document required in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes. Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not impose any requirements of this nature on those wishing to take up or pursue the profession in question, the host Member State shall accept from such nationals a statement issued by a competent authority in that State corresponding to the statement issued in the host Member State. 3. The competent authority of the host Member State may require that the documents and statements referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 are presented no more than three months after their date of issue. 4. Where the competent authority of the host Member State requires nationals of that Member State wishing to take up or pursue a regulated profession to take an oath or make solemn declaration and where the form of such oath or declaration cannot be used by nationals of other Member States, that authority shall ensure that an appropriate and equivalent form of oath or declaration is offered to the person concerned.

"6","31991L0250","Article 1 Object of protection 1. In accordance with the provisions of this Directive, Member States shall protect computer programs, by copyright, as literary works within the meaning of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. For the purposes of this Directive, the term 'computer programs` shall include their preparatory design material.2. Protection in accordance with this Directive shall apply to the expression in any form of a computer program. Ideas and principles which underlie any element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright under this Directive.3. A computer program shall be protected if it is original in the sense that it is the author's own intellectual creation. No other criteria shall be applied to determine its eligibility for protection. Article 2 Authorship of computer programs 1. The author of a computer program shall be the natural person or group of natural persons who has created the program or, where the legislation of the Member State permits, the legal person designated as the rightholder by that legislation. Where collective works are recognized by the legislation of a Member State, the person considered by the legislation of the Member State to have created the work shall be deemed to be its author.2. In respect of a computer program created by a group of natural persons jointly, the exclusive rights shall be owned jointly.3. Where a computer program is created by an employee in the execution of his duties or following the instructions given by his employer, the employer exclusively shall be entitled to exercise all economic rights in the program so created, unless otherwise provided by contract. Article 3 Beneficiaries of protection Protection shall be granted to all natural or legal persons eligible under national copyright legislation as applied to literary works. Article 4 Restricted Acts Subject to the provisions of Articles 5 and 6, the exclusive rights of the rightholder within the meaning of Article 2, shall include the right to do or to authorize:(a) the permanent or temporary reproduction of a computer program by any means and in any form, in part or in whole. Insofar as loading, displaying, running, transmision or storage of the computer program necessitate such reproduction, such acts shall be subject to authorization by the rightholder;(b) the translation, adaptation, arrangement and any other alteration of a computer program and the reproduction of the results thereof, without prejudice to the rights of the person who alters the program;(c) any form of distribution to the public, including the rental, of the original computer program or of copies thereof. The first sale in the Community of a copy of a program by the rightholder or with his consent shall exhaust the distribution right within the Community of that copy, with the exception of the right to control further rental of the program or a copy thereof. Article 5 Exceptions to the restricted acts 1. In the absence of specific contractual provisions, the acts referred to in Article 4 (a) and (b) shall not require authorization by the rightholder where they are necessary for the use of the computer program by the lawful acquirer in accordance with its intended purpose, including for error correction.2. The making of a back-up copy by a person having a right to use the computer program may not be prevented by contract insofar as it is necessary for that use.3. The person having a right to use a copy of a computer program shall be entitled, without the authorization of the rightholder, to observe, study or test the functioning of the program in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program if he does so while performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program which he is entitled to do. Article 6 Decompilation 1. The authorization of the rightholder shall not be required where reproduction of the code and translation of its form within the meaning of Article 4 (a) and (b) are indispensable to obtain the information necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, provided that the following conditions are met:(a) these acts are performed by the licensee or by another person having a right to use a copy of a program, or on their behalf by a person authorized to to so;(b) the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not previously been readily available to the persons referred to in subparagraph (a); and (c) these acts are confined to the parts of the original program which are necessary to achieve interoperability.2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not permit the information obtained through its application:(a) to be used for goals other than to achieve the interoperability of the independently created computer program;(b) to be given to others, except when necessary for the interoperability of the independently created computer program; or (c) to be used for the development, production or marketing of a computer program substantially similar in its expression, or for any other act which infringes copyright.3. In accordance with the provisions of the Berne Convention for the protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the provisions of this Article may not be interpreted in such a way as to allow its application to be used in a manner which unreasonably prejudices the right holder's legitimate interests or conflicts with a normal exploitation of the computer program. Article 7 Special measures of protection 1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 4, 5 and 6, Member States shall provide, in accordance with their national legislation, appropriate remedies against a person committing any of the acts listed in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) below:(a) any act of putting into circulation a copy of a computer program knowing, or having reason to believe, that it is an infringing copy;(b) the possession, for commercial purposes, of a copy of a computer program knowing, or having reason to believe, that it is an infringing copy;(c) any act of putting into circulation, or the possession for commercial purposes of, any means the sole intended purpose of which is to facilitate the unauthorized removal or circumvention of any technical device which may have been applied to protect a computer program.2. Any infringing copy of a computer program shall be liable to seizure in accordance with the legislation of the Member State concerned.3. Member States may provide for the seizure of any means referred to in paragraph 1 (c). Article 8 Term of protection 1. Protection shall be granted for the life of the author and for fifty years after his death or after the death of the last surviving author; where the computer program is an anonymous or pseudonymous work, or where a legal person is designated as the author by national legislation in accordance with Article 2 (1), the term of protection shall be fifty years from the time that the computer program is first lawfully made available to the public. The term of protection shall be deemed to begin on the first of January of the year following the abovementioned events.2. Member States which already have a term of protection longer than that provided for in paragraph 1 are allowed to maintain their present term until such time as the term of protection for copyright works is harmonized by Community law in a more general way. Article 9 Continued application of other legal provisions 1. The provisions of this Directive shall be without prejudice to any other legal provisions such as those concerning patent rights, trade-marks, unfair competition, trade secrets, protection of semi-conductor products or the law of contract. Any contractual provisions contrary to Article 6 or to the exceptions provided for in Article 5 (2) and (3) shall be null and void.2. The provisions of this Directive shall apply also to programs created before 1 January 1993 without prejudice to any acts concluded and rights acquired before that date. Article 10 Final provisions 1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 1 January 1993.When Member States adopt these measures, the latter shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication.

Whenever it appears to the Commission, either on the basis of the reports referred to in paragraph 2 or on the basis of other information that Community credit institutions in a third country do not receive national treatment offering the same competitive opportunities as are available to domestic credit institutions and the the conditions of effective market access are not fulfilled, the Commission may initiate negotiations in order to remedy the situation. In the circumstances described in the first subparagraph, it may also be decided at any time, and in addition to initiating negotiations, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 22 (2), that the competent authorities of the Member States must limit or suspend their decisions regarding requests pending at the moment of the decision or future requests for authorizations and the acquisition of holdings by direct or indirect parent undertakings governed by the laws of the third country in question. The duration of the measures referred to may not exceed three months. Before the end of that three-month period, and in the light of the results of the negotiations, the Council may, acting on a proposal from the Commission, decide by a qualified majority whether the measures shall be continued. Such limitations or suspension may not apply to the setting up of subsidiaries by credit institutions or their subsidiaries duly authorized in the Community, or to the acquisition of holdings in Community credit institutions by such institutions or subsidiaries. 5. Whenever it appears to the Commission that one of the situations described in paragraphs 3 and 4 obtains, the Member States shall inform it at its request: (a) of any request for the authorization of a direct or indirect subsidiary one or more parent undertakings of which are governed by the laws of the third country in question; (b) whenever they are informed in accordance with Article 11 that such an undertaking proposes to acquire a holding in a Community credit institution such that the latter would become its subsidiary. This obligation to provide information shall lapse whenever an agreement is reached with the third country referred to in paragraph 3 or 4 or when the measures referred to in the second and third subparagraphs of paragraph 4 cease to apply. 6. Measures taken pursuant to this Article shall comply with the Community's obligations under any international agreements, bilateral or multilateral, governing the taking-up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions. TITLE IV Harmonization of the conditions governing pursuit of the business of credit institutions Article 10 1. A credit institution's own funds may not fall below the amount of initial capital required pursuant to Article 4 at the time of its authorization. 2. The Member States may decide that credit institutions already in existence when the Directive is implemented, the own funds of which do not attain the levels prescribed for initial capital in Article 4, may continue to carry on their activities. In that event, their own funds may not fall below the highest level reached after the date of the notification of this Directive. 3. If control of a credit institution falling within the category referred to in paragraph 2 is taken by a natural or legal person other than the person who controlled the institution previously, the own funds of that institution must attain at least the level prescribed for initial capital in Article 4. 4. However, in certain specific circumstances and with the consent of the competent authorities, where there is a merger of two or more credit institutions falling within the category referred to in paragraph 2, the own funds of the institution resulting from the merger may not fall below the total own funds of the merged institutions at the time of the merger, as long as the appropriate levels pursuant to Article 4 have not been attained. 5. However, if, in the cases referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, the own funds should be reduced, the competent authorities may, where the circumstances justify it, allow an institution a limited period in which to rectify its situation or cease its activities. Article 11 1. The Member States shall require any natural or legal person who proposes to acquire, directly or indirectly a qualifying holding in a credit institution first to inform the competent authorities, telling them of the size of the intended holding. Such a person must likewise inform the competent authorities if he proposes to increase his qualifying holding so that the proportion of the voting rights or of the capital held by him would reach or exceed 20 %, 33 % or 50 % or so that the credit institution would become his subsidiary. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 2 the competent authorities shall have a maximum of three months from the date of the notification provided for in the first subparagraph to oppose such a plan if, in view of the need to ensure sound and prudent management of the credit institution, they are not satisfied as to the suitablility of the person referred to in the first subparagraph. If they do not oppose the plan referred to in the first subparagraph, they may fix a maximum period for its implementation. 2. If the acquirer of the holdings referred to in paragraph 1 is a credit institution authorized in another Member State or the parent undertaking of a credit institution authorized in another Member State or a natural or legal person controlling a credit institution authorized in another Member State and if, as a result of that acquisition, the institution in which the acquirer proposes to acquire a holding would become a subsidiary or subject to the control of the acquirer, the assessment of the acquisition must be the subject of the prior consultation referred to in Article 7. 3. The Member States shall require any natural or legal person who proposes to dispose, directly or indirectly, of a qualifying holding in a credit institution first to inform the competent authorities, telling them of the size of his intended holding. Such a person must likewise inform the competent authorities if he proposes to reduce his qualifying holding so that the proportion of the voting rights or of the capital held by him would fall below 20 %, 33 % or 50 % or so that the credit institution would cease to be his subsidiary. 4. On becoming aware of them, credit institutions shall inform the competent authorities of any acquisitions or disposals of holdings in their capital that cause holdings to exceed or fall below one of the thresholds referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3. They shall also, at least once a year, inform them of the names of shareholders and members possessing qualifying holdings and the sizes of such holdings as shown, for example, by the information received at the annual general meetings of shareholders and members or as a result of compliance with the regulations relating to companies listed on stock exchanges. 5. The Member States shall require that, where the influence exercised by the persons referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to operate to the detriment of the prudent and sound management of the institution, the competent authorities shall take appropriate measures to put an end to that situation. Such measures may consist for example in injunctions, sanctions against directors and managers, or the suspension of the exercise of the voting rights attaching to the shares held by the shareholders or members in question. Similar measures shall apply to natural or legal persons failing to comply with the obligation to provide prior information, as laid down in paragraph 1. If a holding is acquired despite the opposition of the competent authorities, the Member States shall, regardless of any other sanctions to be adopted, provide either for exercise of the corresponding voting rights to be suspended, or for the nullity of votes cast or for the possibility of their annulment. Article 12 1. No credit institution may have a qualifying holding the amount of which exceeds 15 % of its own funds in an undertaking which is neither a credit institution, nor a financial institution, nor an undertaking carrying on an activity referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 43 (2) (f) of Directive 86/635/EEC. 2. The total amount of a credit institution's qualifying holdings in undertakings other than credit institutions, financial institutions or undertakings carrying on activities referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 43 (2) (f) of Directive 86/635/EEC may not exceed 60 % of its own funds. 3. The Member States need not apply the limits laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 to holdings in insurance companies as defined in Directive 73/239/EEC (16), as last amended by Directive 88/357/EEC (17), and Directive 79/267/EEC (18), as last amended by the Act of Accession of 1985. 4. Shares held temporarily during a financial reconstruction or rescue operation or during the normal course of underwriting or in an institution's own name on behalf of others shall not be counted as qualifying holdings for the purpose of calculating the limits laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2. Shares which are not financial fixed assets as defind in Article 35 (2) of Directive 86/635/EEC shall not be included. 5. The limits laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 may be exceeded only in exceptional circumstances. In such cases, however, the competent authorities shall require a credit institution either to increase its own funds or to take other equivalent measures. 6. Compliance with the limits laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be ensured by means of supervision and monitoring on a consolidated basis in accordance with Directive 83/350/EEC. 7. Credit institutions which, on the date of entry into force of the provisions implementing this Directive, exceed the limits laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall have a period of 10 years from that date in which to comply with them. 8. The Member States may provide that the competent authorities shall not apply the limits laid down in paragraph 1 and 2 if they provide that 100 % of the amounts by which a credit institution's qualifying holdings exceed those limits must be covered by own funds and that the latter shall not be included in the calculation of the solvency ratio. If both the limits laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 are exceeded, the amount to be covered by own funds shall be the greater of the excess amounts. Article 13 1. The prudential supervision of a credit institution, including that of the activities it carries on in accordance with Article 18, shall be the responsibility of the competent authorities of the home Member State, without prejudice to those provisions of this Directive which give responsibility to the authorities of the host Member State. 2. Home Member State competent authorities shall require that every credit institution have sound administrative and accounting procedures and adequate internal control mechanisms. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not prevent supervision on a consolidated basis pursuant to Directive 83/350/EEC. Article 14 1. In Article 7 (1) of Directive 77/780/EEC, the end of the second sentence is hereby replaced by the following: ´and all information likely to facilitate the monitoring of such institutions, in particular with regard to liquidity, solvency, deposit guarantees, the limiting of large exposures, administrative and accounting procedures and internal control mechanisms'. 2. Host Member States shall retain responsibility in cooperation with the competent authorities of the home Member State for the supervision of the liquidity of the branches of credit institutions pending further coordination. Without prejudice to the measures necessary for the reinforcement of the European Monetary System, host Member States shall retain complete responsibility for the measures resulting from the implementation of their monetary policies. Such measures may not provide for discriminatory or restrictive treatment based on the fact that a credit institution is authorized in another Member State. 3. Without prejudice to further coordination of the measures designed to supervise the risks arising out of open positions on markets, where such risks result from transactions carried out on the financial markets of other Member States, the competent authorities of the latter shall collaborate with the competent authorities of the home Member State to ensure that the institutions concerned take steps to cover those risks. Article 15 1. Host Member States shall provide that, where a credit institution authorized in another Member State carries on its activities through a branch, the competent authorities of the home Member State may, after having first informed the competent authorities of the host Member State, carry out themselves or through the intermediary of persons they appoint for that purpose on-the-spot verification of the information referred to in Article 7 (1) of Directive 77/780/EEC. 2. The competent authorities of the home Member State may also, for purposes of the verification of branches, have recourse to one of the other procedures laid down in Article 5 (4) of Directive 83/350/EEC. 3. This Article shall not affect the right of the competent authorities of the host Member State to carry out, in the discharge of their responsibilities under this Directive, on-the-spot verifications of branches established within their territory. Article 16 Article 12 of Directive 77/780/EEC is hereby replaced by the following: ´Article 12 1. The Member States shall provide that all persons working or who have worked for the competent authorities, as well as auditors or experts acting on behalf of the competent authorities, shall be bound by the obligation of professional secrecy. This means that no confidential information which they may receive in the course of their duties may be divulged to any person or authority whatsoever, except in summary or collective form, such that individual institutions cannot be identified, without prejudice to cases covered by criminal law. Nevertheless, where a credit institution has been declared bankrupt or is being compulsorily wound up, confidential information which does not concern third parties involved in attempts to rescue that credit institution may be divulged in civil or commercial proceedings. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not prevent the competent authorities of the various Member States from exchanging information in accordance with the Directives applicable to credit institutions. That information shall be subject to the conditions of professional secrecy indicated in paragraph 1. 3. Member States may conclude cooperation agreements, providing for exchanges of information, with the competent authorities of third countries only if the information disclosed is subject to guarantees of professional secrecy at least equivalent to those referred to in this Article. 4. Competent authorities receiving confidential information under paragraphs 1 or 2 may use it only in the course of their duties: - to check that the conditions governing the taking-up of the business of credit institutions are met and to facilitate monitoring, on a non-consolidated or consolidated basis, of the conduct of such business, especially with regard to the monitoring of liquidity, solvency, large exposures, and administrative and accounting procedures and internal control mechanisms, or - to impose sanctions, or - in an administrative appeal against a decision of the competent authority, or - in court proceedings initiated pursuant to Article 13 or to special provisions provided for in the Directives adopted in the field of credit institutions. 5. Paragraphs 1 and 4 shall not preclude the exchange of information within a Member State, where there are two or more competent authorities in the same Member State, or between Member States, between competent authorities and: - authorities responsible for the supervision of other financial organizations and insurance companies and the authorities responsible for the supervision of financial markets, - bodies involved in the liquidation and bankruptcy of credit institutions and in other similar procedures, - persons responsible for carrying out statutory audits of the accounts of credit institutions and other financial institutions, in the discharge of their supervisory functions, and the disclosure to bodies which administer deposit-guarantee schemes of information necessary to the exercise of their functions. The information received shall be subject to the conditions of professional secrecy indicated in paragraph 1. 6. Nor shall the provisions of this Article preclude a competent authority from disclosing to those central banks which do not supervise credit institutions individually such information as they may need to act as monetary authorities. Information received in this context shall be subject to the conditions of professional secrecy indicated in paragraph 1. 7. In addition, notwithstanding the provisions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4, the Member States may, by virtue of provisions laid down by law, authorize the disclosure of certain information to other departments of their central government administrations responsible for legislation on the supervision of credit institutions, financial institutions, investment services and insurance companies and to inspectors acting on behalf of those departments. However, such disclosures may be made only where necessary for reasons of prudential control. However, the Member States shall provide that information received under paragraphs 2 and 5 and that obtained by means of the on-the-spot verification referred to in Article 15 (1) and (2) of Directive 89/646/EEC (19) may never be disclosed in the cases referred to in this paragraph except with the express consent of the competent authorities which disclosed the information or of the competent authorities of the Member State in which on-the-spot verification was carried out. (20) OJ No L 386, 30. 12. 89, p.1.' Article 17 Without prejudice to the procedures for the withdrawal of authorizations and the provisions of criminal law, the Member States shall provide that their respective competent authorities may, as against credit institutions or those who effectively control the business of credit institutions which breach laws, regulations or administrative provisions concerning the supervision or pursuit of their activities, adopt or impose in respect of them penalties or measures aimed specifically at ending observed breaches or the causes of such breaches. TITLE V Provisions relating to the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services Article 18 1. The Member States shall provide that the activities listed in the Annex may be carried on within their territories, in accordance with Articles 19 to 21, either by the establishment of a branch or by way of the provision of services, by any credit institution authorized and supervised by the competent authorities of another Member State, in accordance with this Directive, provided that such activities are covered by the authorization. 2. The Member States shall also provide that the activities listed in the Annex may be carried on within their territories, in accordance with Articles 19 to 21, either by the establishment of a branch or by way of the provision of services, by any financial institution from another Member State, whether a subsidiary of a credit institution or the jointly-owned subsidiary of two or more credit institutions, the memorandum and articles of association of which permit the carrying on of those activities and which fulfils each of the following conditions: - the parent undertaking or undertakings must be authorized as credit institutions in the Member State by the law of which the subsidiary is governed, - the activities in question must actually be carried on within the territory of the same Member State, - the parent undertaking or undertakings must hold 90 % or more of the voting rights attaching to shares in the capital of the subsidiary, - the parent undertaking or undertakings must satisfy the competent authorities regarding the prudent management of the subsidiary and must have declared, with the consent of the relevant home Member State competent authorities, that they jointly and severally guarantee the commitments entered into by the subsidiary, - the subsidiary must be effectively included, for the activities in question in particular, in the consolidated supervision of the parent undertaking, or of each of the parent undertakings, in accordance with Directive 83/350/EEC, in particular for the calculation of the solvency ratio, for the control of large exposures and for purposes of the limitation of holdings provided for in Article 12 of this Directive. Compliance with these conditions must be verified by the competent authorities of the home Member State and the latter must supply the subsidiary with a certificate of compliance which must form part of the notification referred to in Articles 19 and 20. The competent authorities of the home Member State shall esnure the supervision of the subsidiary in accordance with Articles 10 (1), 11, 13, 14 (1), 15 and 17 of this Directive and Articles 7 (1) and 12 of Directive 77/780/EEC. The provisions mentioned in this paragraph shall be applicable to subsidiaries, subject to the necessary modifications. In particular, the words ´credit institution' should be read as ´financial institution fulfilling the conditions laid down in Article 18 (2)' and the word ´authorization' as ´memorandum and articles of association'. The second subparagraph of Article 19 (3) shall read: ´The home Member State competent authorities shall also communicate the amount of own funds of the subsidiary financial institution and the consolidated solvency ratio of the credit institution which is its parent undertaking.' If a financial institution eligible under this paragraph should cease to fulfil any of the conditions imposed, the home Member State shall notify the competent authorities of the host Member State and the activities carried on by that institution in the host Member State shall become subject to the legislation of the host Member State. Article 19 1. A credit institution wishing to establish a branch within the territory of another Member State shall notify the competent authorities of its home Member State. 2. The Member State shall require every credit institution wishing to establish a branch in another Member State to provide the following information when effecting the notification referred to in paragraph 1: (a) the Member State within the territory of which it plans to establish a branch; (b) a programme of operations setting out inter alia the types of business envisaged and the structural organization of the branch; (c) the address in the host Member State from which documents may be obtained; (d) the names of those responsible for the management of the branch. 3. Unless the competent authorities of the home Member State have reason to doubt the adequacy of the administrative structure or the financial situation of the credit institution, taking into account the activities envisaged, they shall within three months of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 2 communicate that information to the competent authorities of the host Member State and shall inform the institution concerned accordingly. The home Member State competent authorities shall also communicate the amount of own funds and the solvency ratio of the credit institution and, pending subsequent coordination, details of any deposit-guarantee scheme which is intended to ensure the protection of depositors in the branch. Where the competent authorities of the home Member State refuse to communicate the information referred to in paragraph 2 to the competent authorities of the host Member State, they shall give reasons for their refusal to the institution concerned within three months of receipt of all the information. That refusal or failure to reply shall be subject to a right to apply to the courts in the home Member State. 4. Before the branch of a credit institution commences its activities the competent authorities of the host Member State shall, within two months of receiving the information mentioned in paragraph 3, prepare for the supervision of the credit institution in accordance with Article 21 and if necessary indicate the conditions under which, in the interest of the general good, those activities must be carried on in the host Member State. 5. On receipt of a communication from the competent authorities of the host Member State, or in the event of the expiry of the period provided for in paragraph 4 without receipt of any communication from the latter, the branch may be established and commence its activities. 6. In the event of a change in any of the particulars communicated pursuant to paragraph 2 (b), (c) or (d) or in the deposit-guarantee scheme referred to in paragraph 3 a credit institution shall give written notice of the change in question to the competent authorities of the home and host Member States at least one month before making the change so as to enable the competent authorities of the home Member State to take a decision pursuant to paragraph 3 and the competent authorities of the host Member State to take a decision on the change pursuant to paragraph 4. Article 20 1. Any credit institution wishing to exercise the freedom to provide services by carrying on its activities within the territory of another Member State for the first time shall notify the competent authorities of the home Member State of the activities on the list in the Annex which it intends to carry on. 2. The competent authorities of the home Member State shall, within one month of receipt of the notification mentioned in paragraph 1, send that notification to the competent authorities of the host Member State. Article 21 1. Host Member State may, for statistical purposes, require that all credit institutions having branches within their territories shall report periodically on their activities in those host Member States to the competent authorities of those host Member States. In discharging the responsibilities imposed on them in Article 14 (2) and (3), host Member States may require that branches of credit institutions from other Member States provide the same information as they require from national credit institutions for that purpose. 2. Where the competent authorities of a host Member State ascertain that an institution having a branch or providing services within its territory is not complying with the legal provisions adopted in that State pursuant to the provisions of this Directive involving powers of the host Member State competent authorities, those authorities shall require the institution concerned to put an end to that irregular situation. 3. If the institution concerned fails to take the necessary steps, the competent authorities of the host Member State shall inform the competent authorities of the home Member State accordingly. The competent authorities of the home Member State shall, at the earliest opportunity, take all appropriate measures to ensure that the institution concerned puts an end to that irregular situation. The nature of those measures shall be communicated to the competent authorities of the host Member State. 4. If, despite the measures taken by the home Member State or because such measures prove inadequate or are not available in the Member State in question, the institution persists in violating the legal rules referred to in paragraph 2 in force in the host Member State, the latter State may, after informing the competent authorities of the home Member State, take appropriate measures to prevent or to punish further irregularities and, insofar as is necessary, to prevent that institution from initiating further transactions within its territory. The Member States shall ensure that within their territories it is possible to serve the legal documents necessary for these measures on credit institutions. 5. The foregoing provisions shall not affect the power of host Member States to take appropriate measures to prevent or to punish irregularities committed within their territories which are contrary to the legal rules they have adopted in the interest of the general good. This shall include the possibility of preventing offending institutions from initiating any further transactions within their territories. 6. Any measure adopted pursuant to paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 involving penalties or restrictions on the exercise of the freedom to provide services must be properly justified and communicated to the institution concerned. Every such measure shall be subject to a right of appeal to the courts in the Member State the authorities of which adopted it. 7. Before following the procedure provided for in paragraphs 2 to 4, the competent authorities of the host Member State may, in emergencies, take any precautionary measures necessary to protect the interests of depositors, investors and others to whom services are provided. The Commission and the competent authorities of the other Member States concerned must be informed of such measures at the earliest opportunity. The Commission may, after consulting the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, decide that the Member State in question must amend or abolish those measures. 8. Host Member States may exercise the powers conferred on them under this Directive by taking appropriate measures to prevent or to punish irregularities committed within their territories. This shall include the possibility of preventing institutions from initiating further transactions within their territories. 9. In the event of the withdrawal of authorization the competent authorities of the host Member State shall be informed and shall take appropriate measures to prevent the institution concerned from initiating further transactions within its territory and to safeguard the interests of depositors. Every two years the Commission shall submit a report on such cases to the Banking Advisory Committee. 10. The Member States shall inform the Commission of the number and type of cases in which there has been a refusal pursuant to Article 19 or in which measures have been taken in accordance with paragraph 4. Every two years the Commission shall submit a report on such cases to the Banking Advisory Committee. 11. Nothing this Article shall prevent credit institutions with head offices in other Member States from advertising their services through all available means of communication in the host Member State, subject to any rules governing the form and the content of such advertising adopted in the interest of the general good. TITLE VI Final provisions Article 22 1. The technical adaptations to be made to this Directive in the following areas shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 2: - expansion of the content of the list referred to in Article 18 and set out in the Annex or adaptation of the terminology used in that list to take account of developments on financial markets, - alteration of the amount of initial capital prescribed in Article 4 to take account of developments in the economic and monetary field, - the areas in which the competent authorities must exchange information as listed in Article 7 (1) of Directive 77/780/EEC, - clarification of the definitions in order to ensure uniform application of this Directive throughout the Community, - clarification of the definitions in order to take account in the implementation of this Directive of developments on financial markets, - the alignment of terminology on and the framing of definitions in accordance with subsequent acts on credit institutions and related matters. 2. The Commission shall be assisted by a committee composed of representatives of the Member States and chaired by a representative of the Commission. The Commission representative shall submit to the committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter. The opinion shall be delivered by the majority laid down in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty in the case of decisions which the Council is required to adopt on a proposal from the Commission. The votes of the representatives of the Member States in the committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article. The chairman shall not vote. The Commission shall adopt the measures envisaged if they are in accordance with the opinion of the committee. If the measures envisaged are not in accordance with the opinion of the committee, or if no opinion is delivered, the Commission shall, without delay, submit to the Council a proposal concerning the measures to be taken. The Council shall act by a qualified majority. If the Council does not act within three months of the referral to it the Commission shall adopt the measures proposed, unless the Council has decided against those measures by a simple majority. Article 23 1. Branches which have commenced their activities, in accordance with the provisions in force in their host Member States, before the entry into force of the provisions adopted in implementation of this Directive shall be presumed to have been subject to the procedure laid down in Article 19 (1) to (5). They shall be governed, from the date of that entry into force, by Articles 15, 18, 19 (6) and 21. They shall benefit pursuant to Article 6 (3). 2. Article 20 shall not affect rights acquired by credit institutions providing services before the entry into force of the provisions adopted in implementation of this Directive. Article 24 1. Subject to paragraph 2, the Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary for them to comply with this Directive by the later of the two dates laid down for the adoption of measures to comply with Directives 89/299/EEC and 89/647/EEC and at the latest by 1 January 1993.

"10","31989L0665","Article 1 1. The Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that, as regards contract award procedures falling withing the scope of Directives 71/305/EEC and 77/62/EEC, decisions taken by the contracting authorities may be reviewed effectively and, in particular, as rapidly as possible in accordance with the conditions set out in the following Articles, and, in particular, Article 2 (7) on the grounds that such decisions have infringed Community law in the field of public procurement or national rules implementing that law. 2. Member States shall ensure that there is no discrimination between undertakings claiming injury in the context of a procedure for the award of a contract as a result of the distinction made by this Directive between national rules implementing Community law and other national rules. 3. The Member States shall ensure that the review procedures are available, under detailed rules which the Member States may establish, at least to any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular public supply or public works contract and who has been or risks being harmed by an alleged infringement. In particular, the Member States may require that the person seeking the review must have previously notified the contracting authority of the alleged infringement and of his intention to seek review. Article 2 1. The Member States shall ensure that the measures taken concerning the review procedures specified in Article 1 include provision for the powers to: (a) take, at the earliest opportunity and by way of interlocutory procedures, interim measures with the aim of correcting the alleged infringement or preventing further damage to the interests concerned, including measures to suspend or to ensure the suspension of the procedure for the award of a public contract or the implementation of any decision taken by the contracting authority; (b) either set aside or ensure the setting aside of decisions taken unlawfully, including the removal of discriminatory technical, economic or financial specifications in the invitation to tender, the contract documents or in any other document relating to the contract award procedure; (c) award damages to persons harmed by an infringement. 2. The powers specified in paragraph 1 may be conferred on separate bodies responsible for different aspects of the review procedure. 3. Review procedures need not in themselves have an automatic suspensive effect on the contract award procedures to which they relate. 4. The Member States may provide that when considering whether to order interim measures the body responsible may take into account the probable consequences of the measures for all interests likely to be harmed, as well as the public interest, and may decide not to grant such measures where their negative consequences could exceed their benefits. A decision not to grant interim measures shall not prejudice any other claim of the person seeking these measures. 5. The Member States may provide that where damages are claimed on the grounds that a decision was taken unlawfully, the contested decision must first be set aside by a body having the necessary powers. 6. The effects of the exercise of the powers referred to in paragraph 1 on a contract concluded subsequent to its award shall be determined by national law. Furthermore, except where a decision must be set aside prior to the award of damages, a Member State may provide that, after the conclusion of a contract following its award, the powers of the body responsible for the review procedures shall be limited to awarding damages to any person harmed by an infringement. 7. The Member States shall ensure that decisions taken by bodies responsible for review procedures can be effectively enforced. 8. Where bodies responsible for review procedures are not judicial in character, written reasons for their decisions shall always be given. Furthermore, in such a case, provision must be made to guarantee procedures whereby any allegedly illegal measure taken by the review body or any alleged defect in the exercise of the powers conferred on it can be the subject of judicial review or review by another body which is a court or tribunal within the meaning of Article 177 of the EEC Treaty and independent of both the contracting authority and the review body. The members of such an independent body shall be appointed and leave office under the same conditions as members of the judiciary as regards the authority responsible for their appointment, their period of office, and their removal. At least the President of this independent body shall have the same legal and professional qualifications as members of the judiciary. The independent body shall take its decisions following a procedure in which both sides are heard, and these decisions shall, by means determined by each Member State, be legally binding. Article 3 1. The Commission may invoke the procedure for which this Article provides when, prior to a contract being concluded, it considers that a clear and manifest infringement of Community provisions in the field of public procurement has been committed during a contract award procedure falling within the scope of Directives 71/305/EEC and 77/62/EEC. 2. The Commission shall notify the Member State and the contracting authority concerned of the reasons which have led it to conclude that a clear and manifest infringement has been committed and request its correction. 3. Within 21 days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the Member State concerned shall communicate to the Commission: (a) its confirmation that the infringement has been corrected; or (b) a reasoned submission as to why no correction has been made; or (c) a notice to the effect that the contract award procedure has been suspended either by the contracting authority on its own initiative or on the basis of the powers specified in Article 2 (1) (a). 4. A reasoned submission in accordance with paragraph 3 (b) may rely among other matters on the fact that the alleged infringement is already the subject of judicial or other review proceedings or of a review as referred to in Article 2 (8). In such a case, the Member State shall inform the Commission of the result of those proceedings as soon as it becomes known. 5. Where notice has been given that a contract award procedure has been suspended in accordance with paragraph 3 (c), the Member State shall notify the Commission when the suspension is lifted or another contract procedure relating in whole or in part to the same subject matter is begun. That notification shall confirm that the alleged infringement has been corrected or include a reasoned submission as to why no correction has been made. Article 4 1. Not later than four years after the implementation of this Directive, the Commission, in consultation with the Advisory Committee for Public Contracts, shall review the manner in which the provisions of this Directive have been implemented and, if necessary, make proposals for amendments. 2. By 1 March each year the Member States shall communicate to the Commission information on the operation of their national review procedures during the preceding calendar year. The nature of the information shall be determined by the Commission in consultation with the Advisory Committee for Public Contracts. Article 5 Member States shall bring into force, before 1 December 1991, the measures necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main national laws, regulations and administrative provisions which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.

A body governed by public law means any body: - established for the specific purpose of meeting needs in the general interest, not having an industrial or commercial character, and - having legal personality, and - financed, for the most part, by the State, or regional or local authorities, or other bodies governed by public law; or subject to management supervision by those bodies; or having an administrative, managerial or supervisory board, more than half of whose members are appointed by the State, regional or local authorities or by other bodies governed by public law. The lists of bodies or of categories of such bodies governed by public law which fulfil the criteria referred to in the second subparagraph are set out in Annex I. These lists shall be as exhaustive as possible and may be reviewed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30b. To this end, Member States shall periodically notify the Commission of any changes to their lists of bodies and categories of bodies; (c) a ""work'' means the outcome of building or civil engineering works taken as a whole that is sufficient of itself to fulfil an economic and technical function; (d) ""public works concession'' is a contract of the same type as that indicated in (a) except for the fact that the consideration for the works to be carried out consists either solely in the right to exploit the construction or in this right together with payment; (e) ""open procedures'' are those national procedures whereby all interested contractors may submit tenders; (f) ""restricted procedures'' are those national procedures whereby only those contractors invited by the contracting authority may submit tenders; (g) ""negotiated procedures'' are those national procedures whereby contracting authorities consult contractors of their choice and negotiate the terms of the contract with one or more of them; (h) a contractor who submits a tender shall be designated by the term ""tenderer'' and one who has sought an invitation to take part in a restricted and negotiated procedure by the term ""candidate''.' 2. The following Articles are inserted: ´Article 1a 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the contracting authorities comply or ensure compliance with this Directive where they subsidize directly by more than 50 % a works contract awarded by an entity other than themselves. 2. Paragraph 1 shall concern only contracts covered by Class 50, Group 502, of the NACE nomenclature and to contracts relating to building work for hospitals, facilities intended for sports, recreation and leisure, school and university buildings and buildings used for administrative purposes. Article 1b 1. Should contracting authorities conclude a public works concession contract as defined in Article 1 (d), the advertising rules as described in Article 12 (3), (6), (7) and (9) to (13), and in Article 15a, shall apply to that contract when its value is not less than ECU 5 000 000. 2. The contracting authority may: - either require the concessionaire to award contracts representing a minimum of 30 % of the total value of the work for which the concession contract is to be awarded, to third parties, at the same time providing the option for candidates to increase this percentage. This minimum percentage shall be specified in the concession contract, - or request the candidates for concession contracts to specify in their tenders the percentage, if any, of the total value of the work for which the concession contract is to be awarded which they intend to assign to third parties. 3. When the concessionaire is himself one of the authorities awarding contracts within the meaning of Article 1 (b), he shall comply with the provisions of this Directive in the case of works to be carried out by third parties. 4. Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that a concessionaire other than an authority awarding contracts shall apply the advertising rules listed in Article 12 (4), (6), (7), and (9) to (13), and in Article 15b, in respect of the contracts which it awards to third parties when the value of the contracts is not less than ECU 5 000 000. Advertising rules shall not be applied where works contracts meet the conditions laid down in Article 5 (3). Undertakings which have formed a group in order to obtain the concession contract, or undertakings affiliated to them, shall not be regarded as third parties. An ""affiliated undertaking'' means any undertaking over which the concessionaire may exercise, directly or indirectly, a dominant influence or which may exercise a dominant influence over the concessionaire or which, in common with the concessionaire, is subject to the dominant influence of another undertaking by virtue of ownership, financial participation or the rules which govern it. A dominant influence on the part of an undertaking shall be presumed when, directly or indirectly in relation to another undertaking, it: - holds the major part of the undertaking's subscribed capital, or - controls the majority of the votes attaching to shares issued by the undertakings, or - can appoint more than half of the members of the undertaking's administrative, managerial or supervisory body. A comprehensive list of these undertakings shall be enclosed with the candidature for the concession. This list shall be brought up to date following any subsequent changes in the relationship between the undertaking.' 3. Article 2 is hereby repealed. 4.

Article 4 is replaced by the following: ´Article 4 This Directive shall not apply to public contracts governed by different procedural rules and awarded: (a) in pursuance of an international agreement, concluded in conformity with the EEC Treaty, between a Member State and one or more non-member countries and covering works intended for the joint implementation or exploitation of a project by the signatory States; all agreements shall be communicated to the Commission which may consult the Advisory Committee for Public Contracts set up by Decision 71/306/EEC (8), as amended by Decision 77/63/EEC (9); (b) to undertakings in a Member State or a non-member country in pursuance of an international agreement relating to the stationing of troops; (c) pursuant to the particular procedure of an international organization.

The provisions of this Directive shall apply to public works contracts whose estimated value net of VAT is not less than ECU 5 000 000. 2. The value of the threshold in national currencies shall normally be revised every two years with effect from 1 January 1993. The calculation of this value shall be based on the average daily values of these currencies in terms of the ecu over the 24 months terminating on the last day of October immediately preceding the 1 January revision. The values shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities at the beginning of November. 3. Where a work is subdivided into several lots, each one the subject of a contract, the value of each lot must be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the amounts referred to in paragraph 1. Where the aggregate value of the lots is not less than the amount referred to in paragraph 1, the provisions of that paragraph shall apply to all lots. Contracting authorities shall be permitted to depart from this provision for lots whose estimated value net of VAT is less than ECU 1 000 000, provided that the total estimated value of all the lots exempted does not, in consequence, exceed 20 % of the total estimated value of all lots. 4. No work or contract may be split up with the intention of avoiding the application of the preceding paragraphs. 5. When calculating the amounts referred to in paragraph 1 and in Article 5, account shall be taken not only of the amount of the public works contracts but also of the estimated value of the supplies needed to carry out the works which are made available to the contractor by the contracting authorities.' 7. Article 5 is replaced by the following: ´Article 5 1. In awarding public works contracts the contracting authorities shall apply the procedures defined in Article 1 (e), (f) and (g), adapted to this Directive. 2. The contracting authorities may award their public works contracts by negotiated procedure, with prior publication of a tender notice and after having selected the candidates according to qualitative public criteria, in the following cases: (a) in the event of irregular tenders in response to an open or restricted procedure or in the event of tenders which are unacceptable under national provisions that are in accordance with the provisions of Title IV, in so far as the original terms of the contract are not substantially altered. The contracting authorities shall not, in these cases, publish a tender notice where they include in such negotiated procedure all the enterprises satisfying the criteria of Articles 23 to 28 which, during the prior open or restricted procedure, have submitted offers in accordance with the formal requirements of the tendering procedure; (b) when the works involved are carried out purely for the purpose of research, experiment or development, and not to establish commercial viability or to recover research and development costs; (c) in exceptional cases, when the nature of the works or the risks attaching thereto do not permit prior overall pricing. 3. The contracting authorities may award their public works contracts by negotiated procedure without prior publication of a tender notice, in the following cases: (a) in the absence of tenders or of appropriate tenders in response to an open or restricted procedure in so far as the original terms of the contract are not substantially altered and provided that a report is communicated to the Commission at its request; (b) when, for technical or artistic reasons or for reasons connected with the protection of exclusive rights, the works may only be carried out by a particular contractor; (c) in so far as is strictly necessary when, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseen by the contracting authorities in question, the time limit laid down for the open, restricted or negotiated procedures referred to in paragraph 2 above cannot be kept. The circumstances invoked to justify extreme urgency must not in any event be attributable for the contracting authorities; (d) for additional works not included in the project initially considered or in the contract first concluded but which have, through unforeseen circumstances, become necessary for the carrying out of the work described therein, on condition that the award is made to the contractor carrying out such work: - when such works cannot be technically or economically separated from the main contract without great inconvenience to the contracting authorities, or - when such works, although separable from the execution of the original contract, are strictly necessary to its later stages, however, the aggregate value of contracts awarded for additional works may not exceed 50 % of the amount of the main contract; (e) for new works consisting of the repetition of similar works entrusted to the undertaking to which the same contracting authorities awarded an earlier contract, provided that such works conform to a basic project for which a first contract was awarded according to the procedures referred to in paragraph 4. As soon as the first project is put up for tender, notice must be given that this procedure might be adopted and the total estimated cost of subsequent works shall be taken into consideration by the contracting authorities when they apply the provisions of Article 4a. This procedure may only be applied during the three years following the conclusion of the original contract. 4. In all other cases, the contracting authorities shall award their public works contracts by the open procedure or by the restricted procedure.' 8. The following Article is inserted: ´Article 5a 1. The contracting authority shall, within 15 days of the date on which the request is received, inform any eliminated candidate or tenderer who so requests of the reasons for rejection of his application or his tender, and, in the case of a tender, the name of the sucessful tenderer. 2. The contracting authority shall inform candidates or tenderers who so request of the grounds on which it decided not to award a contract in respect of which a prior call for competition was made, or to recommence the procedure. It shall also inform the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities of that decision. 3. For each contract awarded the contracting authorities shall draw up a written report which shall include at least the following: - the name and address of the contracting authority, the subject and value of the contract, - the names of the candidates or tenderers admitted and the reasons for their selection, - the names of the candidates or tenderers rejected and the reasons for their rejection, - the name of the successful tenderer and the reasons for his tender having been selected and, if known, any share of the contract the successful tenderer may intend to subcontract to a third party, - for negotiated procedures, the circumstances referred to in Article 5 which justify the use of these procedures. This report, or the main features of it, shall be communicated to the Community at its request.' 9. Article 7, 8 and 9 are hereby repealed. 10. Article 10 is replaced by the following: ´Article 10 1. The technical specifications defined in Annex III shall be given in the general or contractual documents relating to each contract. 2. Without prejudice to the legally binding national technical rules and in so far as these are compatible with Community law, such technical specifications shall be defined by the contracting authorities by reference to national standards implementing European standards, or by reference to European technical approvals or by reference to common technical specifications. 3. A contracting authority may depart from paragraph 2 if: (a) the standards, European technical approvals or common technical specifications do not include any provision for establishing conformity, or technical means do not exist for establishing satisfactorily the conformity of a product to these standards, European technical approvals or common technical specifications; (b) use of these standards, European technical approvals or common technical specifications would oblige the contracting authority to acquire products or materials incompatible with equipment already in use or would entail disproportionate costs or disproportionate technical difficulties, but only as part of a clearly defined and recorded strategy with a view to change-over, within a given period, to European standards, European technical approvals or common technical specifications; (c) the project concerned is of a genuinely innovative nature for which use of existing European standards, European technical approvals or common technical specifications would not be appropriate. 4. Contracting authorities invoking paragraph 3 shall record, wherever possible, the reasons for doing so in the tender notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities or in the contract documents and in all cases shall record these reasons in their internal documentation and shall supply such information on request to Member States and to the Commission. 5. In the absence of European standards or European technical approvals or common technical specifications, the technical specifications: (a) shall be defined by reference to the national technical specifications recognized as complying with the basic requirements listed in the Community directives on technical harmonization, in accordance with the procedures laid down in those directives, and in particular in accordance with the procedures laid down in Council Directive 89/106/EEC of 21 December 1988 on construction products (12); (b) may be defined by reference to national technical specifications relating to design and method of calculation and execution of works and use of materials; (c) may be defined by reference to other documents. In this case, it is appropriate to make reference in order of preference to: ii(i) national standards implementing international standards accepted by the country of the contracting authority; i(ii) other national standards and national technical approvals of the country of the contracting authority; (iii) any other standard. 6. Unless such specifications are justified by the subject of the contract, Member States shall prohibit the introduction into the contractual clauses relating to a given contract of technical specifications which mention products of a specific make or source or of a particular process and which therefore favour or eliminate certain undertakings. In particular, the indication of trade marks, patents, types, or of a specific origin or production shall be prohibited. However, if such indication is accompanied by the words ""or equivalent'', it shall be authorized in cases where the authorities awarding contracts are unable to give a description of the subject of the contract using specifications which are sufficiently precise and intelligible to all parties concerned. (13) OJ No L 40, 11. 2. 1989, p. 12.' 11. Article 11 is hereby repealed. 12. Articles 12 to 15 are replaced by the following: ´Article 12 1.

Contracting authorities who have awarded a contract shall make known the result by means of a notice. However, certain information on contract award may, in certain cases, not be published where release of such information would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private, or might prejudice fair competition between contractors. 6. The contracting authorities shall send the notices referred to in the preceding paragraphs as rapidly as possible and by the most appropriate channels to the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities. In the case of the accelerated procedure referred to in Article 15, the notice shall be sent by telex, telegram or telefax.

The follwing Articles are inserted: ´Article 20a Where the criterion for the award of the contract is that of the most economically advantageous tender, contracting authorities may take account of variants which are submitted by a tenderer and meet the minimum specifications required by the contracting authorities. The contracting authorities shall state in the contract documents the minimum specifications to be respected by the variants and any specific requirements for their presentation. They shall indicate in the tender notice whether variants will be considered. Contracting authorities may not reject the submission of a variant on the sole grounds that it has been drawn up with technical specifications defined by reference to national standards transposing European standards, to European technical approvals or to common technical specifications referred to in Article 10 (2) or again by reference to national technical specifications referred to in Article 10 (5) (a) and (b). Article 20b In the contract documents, the contracting authority may ask the tenderer to indicate in his tender any share of the contract he may intend to subcontract to third parties. This indication shall be without prejudice to the question of the principal contractor's responsibility.' 17. Article 22 is replaced by the following: ´Article 22 1. In restricted and negotiated procedures the contracting authorities shall, on the basis of information given relating to the contractor's personal position as well as to the information and formalities necessary for the evaluation of the minimum conditions of an economic and technical nature to be fulfilled by him, select from among the candidates with the qualifications required by Articles 23 and 28 those whom they will invite to submit a tender or to negotiate. 2. Where the contracting authorities award a contract by restricted procedure, they may prescribe the range within which the number of undertakings which they intend to invite will fall. In this case the range shall be indicated in the contract notice. The range shall be determined in the light of the nature of the work to be carried out. The range must number at least 5 undertakings and may be up to 20. In any event, the number of candidates invited to tender shall be sufficient to ensure genuine competition. 3. Where the contracting authorities award a contract by negotiated procedure as referred to in Article 5 (2), the number of candidates admitted to negotiate may not be less than three provided that there is a sufficient number of suitable candidates. 4. Each Member State shall ensure that contracting authorities issue invitations without discrimination to those nationals of other Member States who satisfy the necessary requirements and under the same conditions as to its own nationals.' 18.

The contracting authority which supplies the information referred to in paragraph 1 shall request the tenderers or those participating in the contract procedure to indicate that they have taken account, when drawing up their tender, of the obligations relating to employment protection provisions and the working conditions which are in force in the place where the work is to be carried out. This shall be without prejudice to the application of the provisions of Article 29 (5) concerning the examination of abnormally low tenders.' 19. Article 24 is hereby replaced by the following: ´Article 24 Any contractor wishing to take part in a public works contract may be requested to prove his enrolment in the professional or trade register under the conditions laid down by the laws of the Member State in which he is established: - in Belgium, the registre du commerce - Handelsregister, - in Denmark, the Erhvervs- og Selskabsstyrelsen, - in Germany, the Handelsregister and the Handwerksrolle, - in Greece, a declaration on the exercise of the profession of public works contractor made on oath before a notary may be required, - in Spain, the Registro Oficial de Contratistas del Ministerio de Industria y Energia, - in France, the registre du commerce and the rÃ ©pertoir des mÃ ©tiers, - in Italy, the Registro della Camera di commercio, industria, agricoltura e artigianato, - in Luxembourg, the registre aux firmes and the rÃ ´le de la Chambre des mÃ ©tiers, - in the Netherlands, the Handelsregister, - in Portugal, the Commissao de AlvarÃ ¡s de Empresas de Obras PÃ ºblicas e Particulares (CAEOPP), - in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the contractor may be requested to provide a certificate from the Registrar of Companies or the Registrar of Friendly Societies or, if this is not the case, a certificate stating that the person concerned has declared on oath that he is engaged in the profession in question in the country in which he is established, in a specific place and under a given business name.' 20. Article 29 (3) is hereby repealed and Article 29 (4) and (5) replaced by the following: ´4. Paragraph 1 shall not apply when a Member State bases the award of contracts on other criteria, within the framework of rules in force at the time of the adoption of this Directive whose aim is to give preference to certain tenderers, on condition that the rules invoked are compatible with the Treaty. 5. If, for a given contract, tenders appear to be abnormally low in relation to the transaction, before it may reject those tenders the contracting authority shall request, in writing, details of the constituent elements of the tender which it considers relevant and shall verify those constituent elements taking account of the explanations received. The contracting authority may take into consideration explanations which are justified on objective grounds including the economy of the construction method, or the technical solutions chosen, or the exceptionally favourable conditions available to the tenderer for the execution of the work, or the originality of the work proposed by the tenderer. If the documents relating to the contract provide for its award at the lowest price tendered, the contracting authority must communicate to the Commission the rejection of tenders which it considers to be too low. However, until the end of 1992, if current national law so permits, the contracting authority may exceptionally, without any discrimination on grounds of nationality, reject tenders which are abnormally low in relation to the transaction, without being obliged to comply with the procedure provided for in the first subparagraph if the number of such tenders for a particular contract is so high that implementation of this procedure would lead to a considerable delay and jeopardize the public interest attaching to the execution of the contract in question. Recourse to this exceptional procedure shall be mentioned in the notice referred to in Article 12 (5).' 21. The following Articles are inserted in Title V: ´Article 29a 1. Until 31 December 1992, this Directive shall not prevent the application of existing national provisions on the award of public works contracts which have as their objective the reduction of regional disparities and the promotion of job creation in regions whose development is lagging behind and in declining industrial regions, on condition that the provisions concerned are compatible with the Treaty, in particular with the principles of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services, and with the Community's international obligations. 2. Paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to Article 29 (4). Article 29b 1. Member States shall inform the Commission of national provisions covered by Article 29 (4) and Article 29a and of the rules for applying them. 2. Member States concerned shall forward to the Commission, every year, a report describing the implementation of these provisions. The reports shall be submitted to the Advisory Committee for Public Works Contracts.' 22. The following Articles are inserted: ´Article 30a 1. In order to permit assessment of the results of applying the Directive, Member States shall forward to the Commission a statistical report on the contracts awarded by contracting authorities by 31 October 1993 at the latest for the preceding year and thereafter by 31 October of every second year. Nevertheless, for the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic, the date of 31 October 1993 shall be replaced by 31 October 1995. 2. This report shall detail at least the number and value of contracts awarded by each contracting authority or category of contracting authority above the threshold, subdivided as far as possible by procedure, category of work and the nationality of the contractor to whom the contract has been awarded, and in the case of negotiated procedures, subdivided in accordance with Article 5, listing the number and value of the contracts awarded to each Member State and to third countries. 3. The Commission shall determine the nature of any additional statistical information, which is requested in accordance with the Directive, in consultation with the Advisory Committee for Public Works Contracts. Article 30b 1. Annex I to this Directive shall be amended by the Commission when, in particular on the basis of the notifications from the Member States, it is necessary: (a) to remove from Annex I bodies governed by public law which no longer fulfil the criteria laid down in Article 1(b); (b) to include in that Annex bodies governed by public law which meet those criteria. 2. Amendments to Annex I shall be made by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee for Public Works Contracts. The chairman of the committee shall submit to the committee a draft of any measures to be taken. The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft, if necessary by taking a vote, within a time limit to be fixed by the chairman in the light of the urgency of the matter.

Where, pursuant to Article 7 (3), an employer enlists competent external services or persons, this shall not discharge him from his responsibilities in this area. 3. The workers' obligations in the field of safety and health at work shall not affect the principle of the responsibility of the employer. 4. This Directive shall not restrict the option of Member States to provide for the exclusion or the limitation of employers' responsibility where occurrences are due to unusual and unforeseeable circumstances, beyond the employers' control, or to exceptional events, the consequences of which could not have been avoided despite the exercise of all due care. Member States need not exercise the option referred to in the first subparagraph. Article 6 General obligations on employers 1. Within the context of his responsibilities, the employer shall take the measures necessary for the safety and health protection of workers, including prevention of occupational risks and provision of information and training, as well as provision of the necessary organization and means. The employer shall be alert to the need to adjust these measures to take account of changing circumstances and aim to improve existing situations. 2. The employer shall implement the measures referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 on the basis of the following general principles of prevention: (a) avoiding risks; (b) evaluating the risks which cannot be avoided: (c) combating the risks at source; (d) adapting the work to the individual, especially as regards the design of work places, the choice of work equipment and the choice of working and production methods, with a view, in particular, to alleviating monotonous work and work at a predetermined work-rate and to reducing their effect on health.

"13","31989L0299","Article 1 Scope 1. Wherever a Member State lays down by law, regulation or administrative action a provision in implementation of Community legislation concerning the prudential supervision of an operative credit institution which uses the term or refers to the concept of own funds, it shall bring this term or concept into line with the definition given in the following Articles. 2. For the purposes of this Directive, ´credit institutions' shall mean the institutions to which Directive 77/780/EEC (7), as last amended by Directive 86/524/EEC (8), applies. Article 2 General principles 1. Subject to the limits imposed in Article 6, the unconsolidated own funds of credit institutions shall consist of the following items: (1) capital within the meaning of Article 22 of Directive 86/635/EEC, in so far as it has been paid up, plus share premium accounts but excluding cumulative preferential shares; (2) reserves within the meaning of Article 23 of Directive 86/635/EEC and profits and losses brought forward as a result of the application of the final profit or loss. The Member States may permit inclusion of interim profits before a formal decision has been taken only if these profits have been verified by persons responsible for the auditing of the accounts and if it is proved to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that the amount thereof has been evaluated in accordance with the principles set out in Directive 86/635/EEC and is net of any foreseeable charge or dividend; (3) revaluation reserves within the meaning of Article 33 of Council Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 based on Article 54 (3) (g) of the Treaty on the annual accounts of certain types of companies (9), as last amended by Directive 84/569/EEC (10); (4) funds for general banking risks within the meaning of Article 38 of Directive 86/635/EEC; (5) value adjustments within the meaning of Article 37 (2) of Directive 86/635/EEC; (6) other items within the meaning of Article 3; (7) the commitments of the members of credit institutions set up as cooperative societies and the joint and several commitments of the borrowers of certain institutions organized as funds, as referred to in Article 4 (1); (8) fixed-term cumulative preferential shares and subordinated loan capital as referred to in Article 4 (3). The following items shall be deducted in accordance with Article 6: (9) own shares at book value held by a credit institution; (10) intangible assets within the meaning of Article 4 (9) ( ´assets') of Directive 86/635/EEC; (11) material losses of the current financial year; (12) holdings in other credit and financial institutions amounting to more than 10 % of their capital, subordinated claims and the instruments referred to in Article 3 which a credit institution holds in respect of credit and financial institutions in which it has holdings exceeding 10 % of the capital in each case. Where shares in another credit or financial institution are held temporarily for the purposes of a financial assistance operation designed to reorganize and save that institution, the supervisory authority may waive this provision; (13) holdings in other credit and financial institutions of up to 10 % of their capital, the subordinated claims and the instruments referred to in Article 3 which a credit institution holds in respect of credit and financial institutions other than those referred to in point 12 in respect of the amount of the total of such holdings, subordinated claims and instruments which exceed 10 % of that credit institution's own funds calculated before the deduction of items 12 and 13. Pending subsequent coordination of the provisions on consolidation, Member States may provide that, for the calculation of unconsolidated own funds, parent companies subject to supervision on a consolidated basis need not deduct their holdings in other credit institutions or financial institutions which are included in the consolidation. This provision shall apply to all the prudential rules harmonized by Community acts. 2. The concept of own funds as defined in points 1 to 8 of paragraph 1 embodies a maximum number of items and amounts. The use of those items and the fixing of lower ceilings, and the deduction of items other than those listed in items 9 to 13 of paragraph 1 shall be left to the discretion of the Member States. Member States shall nevertheless be obliged to consider increased convergence with a view to a common definition of own funds. To that end, the Commission shall, not more than three years after the date referred to in Article 9 (1), submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of this Directive, accompanied, where appropriate, by such proposals for amendment as it shall deem necessary. Within five years of the date referred to in Article 9 (1), the Council shall, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, in cooperation with the European Parliament and after consultation of the Economic and Social Committee, examine the definition of own funds with a view to the uniform application of the common definition. 3. The items listed in points 1 to 5 must be available to a credit institution for unrestricted and immediate use to cover risks or losses as soon as these occur. The amount must be net of any foreseeable tax charge at the moment of its calculation or be suitably adjusted in so far as such tax charges reduce the amount up to which these items may be applied to cover risks or losses. Article 3 Other items referred to in Article 2 (1) (6) 1. The concept of own funds used by a Member State may include other items provided that, whatever their legal or accounting designations might be, they have the following characteristics: (a) they are freely available to the credit institution to cover normal banking risks where revenue or capital losses have not yet been identified; (b) their existence is disclosed in internal accounting records; (c) their amount is determined by the management of the credit institution, verified by independent auditors, made known to the competent authorities and placed under the supervision of the latter. With regard to verification, internal auditing may be considered as provisionally meeting the aforementioned requirements until such time as the Community provisions making external auditing mandatory have been implemented. 2. Securities of indeterminate duration and other instruments that fulfil the following conditions may also be accepted as other items: (a) they may not be reimbursed on the bearer's initiative or without the prior agreement of the supervisory authority; (b) the debt agreement must provide for the credit institution to have the option of deferring the payment of interest on the debt; (c) the lender's claims on the credit institution must be wholly subordinated to those of all non-subordinated creditors; (d) the documents governing the issue of the securities must provide for debt and unpaid interest to be such as to absorb losses, whilst leaving the credit institution in a position to continue trading; (e) only fully paid-up amounts shall be taken into account. To these may be added cumulative preferential shares other than those referred to in Article 2 (1) (8). Article 4 1. The commitments of the members of credit institutions set up as cooperative societies referred to in Article 2 (1) (7), shall comprise those societies' uncalled capital, together with the legal commitments of the members of those cooperative societies to make additional non-refundable payments should the credit institution incur a loss, in which case it must be possible to demand those payments without delay. The joint and several commitments of borrowers in the case of credit institutions organized as funds shall be treated in the same way as the preceding items. All such items may be included in own funds in so far as they are counted as the own funds of institutions of this category under national law. 2. Member States shall not include in the own funds of public credit institutions guarantees which they or their local authorities extend to such entities. However, the Kingdom of Belgium shall be exempt from this obligation until 31 December 1994. 3. Member States or the competent authorities may include fixed-term cumulative preferential shares referred to in Article 2 (1) (8) and subordinated loan capital referred to in that provision in own funds, if binding agreements exist under which, in the event of the bankruptcy or liquidation of the credit institution, they rank after the claims of all other creditors and are not to be repaid until all other debts outstanding at the time have been settled. Subordinated loan capital must also fulfil the following criteria: (a) only fully paid-up funds may be taken into account; (b) the loans involved must have an original maturity of at least five years, after which they may be repaid; if the maturity of the debt is not fixed, they shall be repayable only subject to five years' notice unless the loans are no longer considered as own funds or unless the prior consent of the competent authorities is specifically required for early repayment. The competent authorities may grant permission for the early repayment of such loans provided the request is made at the initiative of the issuer and the solvency of the credit institution in question is not affected; (c) the extent to which they may rank as own funds must be gradually reduced during at least the last five years before the repayment date; (d) the loan agreement must not include any clause providing that in specified circumstances, other than the winding up of the credit institution, the debt will become repayable before the agreed repayment date. Article 5 Until further coordination of the provisions on consolidation, the following rules shall apply. 1. Where the calculation is to be made on a consolidated basis, the consolidated amounts relating to the items listed under Article 2 (1) shall be used in accordance with the rules laid down in Directive 83/350/EEC. Moreover, the following may, when they are credit ( ´negative') items, be regarded as consolidated reserves for the calculation of own funds: - any minority interests within the meaning of Article 21 of Directive 83/349/EEC, where the global integration method is used, - the first consolidation difference within the meaning of Articles 19, 30 and 31 of Directive 83/ 349/EEC, - the translation differences included in consolidated reserves in accordance with Article 39 (6) of Directive 86/635/EEC, - any difference resulting from the inclusion of certain participating interests in accordance with the method prescribed in Article 33 of Directive 83/349/EEC. 2. Where the above are debit ( ´positive') items, they must be deducted in the calculation of consolidated own funds. Article 6 Deductions and limits 1. The items referred to in Article 2 (1), points 3 and 5 to 8, shall be subject to the following limits: (a) the total of items 3 and 5 to 8 may not exceed a maximum of 100 % of items 1 plus 2 minus 9, 10 and 11; (b) the total of items 7 and 8 may not exceed a maximum of 50 % of items 1 plus 2 minus 9, 10 and 11; (c) the total of items 12 and 13 shall be deducted from the total of all items. 2. The item referred to in Article 2 (1) (4) shall constitute a separate category. Provisionally, it shall be included in own funds without limit, but shall not be included when the basis of the limit for the items referred to in points 3 and 5 to 8 is fixed. Within six months of the implementation of this Directive the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 8, propose the final treatment for this item either in original own funds or in additional own funds. 3. The limits referred to in paragraph 1 must be complied with as from the date of the entry into force of the implementing measures for the Council Directive on a solvency ratio for credit institutions and by 1 January 1993 at the latest. Credit institutions exceeding those limits must gradually reduce the extent to which the items referred to in Article 2 (1), points 3 and 5 to 8, are taken into account so that they comply with those limits before the aforementioned date. 4. The competent authorities may authorize credit institutions to exceed the limit laid down in paragraph 1 in temporary and exceptional circumstances. Article 7 Compliance with the conditions laid down in Articles 2 to 6 must be proved to the satisfaction of the competent authorities. Article 8 Without prejudice to the report referred to in Article 2 (2), second subparagraph, technical adaptations deemed to be necessary to this Directive to: - clarify the definitions to ensure uniform application of the said Directive throughout the Community, - clarify the definitions to take account, in implementing the said Directive, of developments on the financial markets, - bring the terminology and wording of the definitions into line with that of subsequent acts concerning credit institutions and related areas, shall be adopted by the Council acting by a qualified majority on a Commission proposal. Article 9 1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary for them to comply with this Directive no later than the date laid down for the entry into force of the implementing measures of the Council directive on a solvency ratio for credit institutions, and by 1 January 1993 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive. 3. The communication referred to in paragraph 2 must also include a statement, accompanied by an explanatory text, notifying the Commission of the specific provisions adopted and the items selected by the Member States' respective competent authorities as comprising own funds.

whereas it is therefore necessary, in view of the establishment and functioning of the internmal market, to approximate the laws of Member States;Whereas it is important not to disregard the solutions and advantages which the Community trade mark system may afford to undertakings wishing to acquire trade marks;Whereas it does not appear to be necessary at present to undertake full-scale approximation of the trade mark laws of the Member States and it will be sufficient if approximation is limited to those national provisions of law which most directly affect the functioning of the internal market;Whereas the Directive does not deprive the Member States of the right to continue to protect trademarks acquired through use but takes them into account only in regard to the relationship between them and trade marks acquired by registration;Whereas Member States also remain free to fix the provisions of procedure concerning the registration, the revocation and the invalidity of trade marks acquired by registration; whereas they can, for example, determine the form of trade mark registration and invalidity procedures, decide whether earlier rights should be invoked either in the registration procedure or in the invalidity procedure or in both and, if they allow earlier rights to be invoked in the registration procedure, have an opposition procedure or an ex officio examination procedure or both; whereas Member States remain free to determine the effects of revocation or invalidity of trade marks;Whereas this Directive does not exclude the application to trade marks of provisions of law of the Member States other than trade mark law, such as the provisions relating to unfair competition, civil liability or consumer protection;Whereas attainment of the objectives at which this approximation of laws is aiming requires that the conditions for obtaining and continuing to hold a registered trade mark are, in general, identical in all Member States; whereas, to this end, it is necessary to list examples of signs which may constitute a trade mark, provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of othrefusal or invalidity concemning the trade mark itself, for example, the absence of any distinctive character, or concerning conflicts between the trade mark and earlier rights, are to be listed in an exhaustive manner, even if some of these grounds are listed as an option for the Member States which will therefore be able to maintain or introduce those grounds in their legislation; whereas Member States will be able to maintain or introduce into their legislation grounds of refusal or invalidity linked to conditions for obtaining and continning to hold a trade mark for which there is no provision of approximation, concerning, for example, the eligibility for the grant of a trade mark, the renewal of the trade mark or rules on fees, or related to the non-compliance with procedural rules;Whereas in order to reduce the total number of trade marks registered and protected in the Community and, consequently, the number of conflicts which arise between them, it is essential to require that registered trade marks must actually be used or, if not used, be subject to revocation; whereas it is necessary to provide that a trade mark cannot be invalidated on the basis of the existence of a non-used earlier trade mark, while the Member States remain free to apply the same principle in respect of the registration of a trade mark or to provide that a trade mark may not be successfully invoked in infringement proceedings if it is established as a result of a plea that the trade mark could be revoked; whereas in all these cases it is up to the Member States to establish the applicable rules of procedure;Whereas it is fundamental, in order to facilitate the free circulation of goods and services, to ensure that henceforth registered trade marks enjoy the same protection under the legal systems of all the Member States; whereas this should however not prevent the Member States from granting at their option extensive protection to those trade marks which have a reputation;Whereas the protection afforded by the registered trade mark, the function of which is in particular to guarantee the trade mark as an indication of origin, is absolute in the case of identity between the mark and the sign and goods or services; whereas the protection applies also in case of similarity between the mark and the sign and the goods or services; whereas it is indispensable to give an interpretation of the concept of similarity in relation to the likelihood of confusion; whereas the likelihood of confusion, the appreciation of which depends on numerous elements and, in particular, on the recognition of the trade mark on the market, of the association which can be made with the used or registered sign, of the degree of similarity between the trade mark and the sign and between the goods or services identified, constitutes the specific condition for such protection; whereas the ways in which likelihood of confusion may be established, and in particular the onus of proof, are a matter for national Procedural rules which are not prejudiced by the Directive;Whereas it is important, for reasons of legal certainty and without inequitably prejudicing the interests of a proprietor of an earlier trade mark, to Provide that the latter may no longer request a declaration of invalidity nor may he oppose the use of a trade mark subsequent to his own of which he has knowingly tolerated the use for a substantial length of time, unless the application for the subsequent trade mark was made in bad faith:Whereas all Member States of the Community are bound by the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property; whereas it is necessary that the provisions of this Directive are entirely consistent with those of the Paris Convention; whereas the obligations of the Member States resulting from this Convention are not affected by this Directive; whereas, where appropriate, the second subparagraph of Article 234 of the Treaty is applicable,HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:Article 1ScopeThis Directive shall apply to every trade mark in respect of goods or services which is the subject of registration or of an application in a Member State for registration as an individual trade mark, a collective mark or a guarantee or certification mark, or which is the subject of a registration or an application for registration in the Benelux Trade Mark Office or of an international registration having effect in a Member State.Article 2Signs of which a trade mark may consistA trade mark may consist of any sign capable of being represented graphically, particularly words, including personal names, designs, letters, numerals, the shape of goods or of their packaging, provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings.Article 3Grounds for refusal or invalidity1. he following shall not be registered or if registered shall be liable to be declared invalid:(a) signs which cannot constitute a trade mark;(b) trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character;(c) trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve, in trade, to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, or the time of production of the goods or of rendering of the service, or other characteristics of the goods o(d) trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade;(e) signs which consist exclusively of:- the shape which results from the nature of the goods themselves, or- the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result, or- the shape which gives substantial value to the goods;(f) trade marks which are contrary to public policy or to accepted principles of morality;(g) trade marks which are of such a nature as to deceive the public, for instance as to the nature, quality or geographicai origin of the goods or service;(h) trade marks which have not been authorized by the competent authorities and are to be refused or invalidated pursuant to Article 6 ter of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, hereinafter referred to as the 'Paris Convention'.2. Any Member State may provide that a trade mark shall not be registered or, if registered, shall be liable to be declared invalid where and to the extent that:(a) the use of that trade mark may be prohibited pursuant to provisions of law other than trade mark law of the Member State concerned or of the Community;(b) the trade mark covers a sign of high symbolic value, in particul.ar a religious symbol;(c) the trade mark includes badges, emblems and escutcheons other than those coved by Article 6 ter of the Paris Convention and which are of Public interest, unless the consent of the appropriate authorities to its registration has been given in conformity with the legislation of the Member State;(d) the application for registration of the trade mark was made in bad faith by the applicant.3. A trade mark shall not be refused registration or be declared invalid in accordance with paragraph 1 (b), (c) or (d) if, before the date of application for registration and following the use which has been made of it, it has acquired a distinctive character. Any Member State may in addition provide that this provision shall also apply where the distinctive character was acquired after the date of application for registration or after the date of registration.4. Any Member State may provide that, by derogation from the preceding paragraphs, the grounds of refusal of registration or invalidity in force in that State prior to the date on which the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive enter into force, shall apply to trade marks for which application has been made prior to that date.Article 4Further grounds for refusal or invalidity concerning conflicts with earlier rights1. A trade mark shall not be registered or, if registered, shall be liable to be declared invalid:(a) if it is identical with an earlier trade mark, and the goods or services for which the trade mark is applied for or is registered are identical with the goods or services for which the earlier trade mark is protected;(b) if because of its identity with, or similarity to,the earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade marks, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade mark.2. 'Earlier trade marks' within the meaning of paragraph 1 means:(a) trade marks of the following kinds with a date of application for registration which is earlier than the date of application for registration of the trade mark, taking account, where appropriate, of the priorities claimed in respect of those trade marks; (i) Community trade marks;(ii) trade marks registered in the Member State or, in the case of Belgium, Luxembourg or the Netherlands, at the Benelux Trade Mark Office;(iii) trade marks registered under international arrangements which have effect in the Member State;(b) Community trade marks which validly claim seniority, in accordance with the Regulation on the Community trade mark, from a trade mark referred to in (a) (ii) and (iii), even when the latter trade mark has been surrendered or allowed to lapse;(c) applications for the trade marks referred to in (a) and (b), subject to their registration;(d) trade marks which, on the date of application for registration of the trade mark, or, where appropriate, of the priority claimed in respect of the application for registration of the trade mark, are well known in a Member State, in the sense in which the words 'well known' are used in Article 6 bis of the Paris Convention.3. A trade mark shall furthermore not be registered or, if registered, shall be liable to be declared invalid if it is identical with, or similar to, an earlier Community trade mark within the meaning of paragraph 2 and is to be, or has been, registered for goods or services which are not similar to those for which the earlier Community trade mark is registered, where the earlier Community trade mark has a reputation in the Community and where the use of the later trade mark without due cause would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the ea4. Any Member State may furthermore provide that a trade mark shall not be registered or, if registered, shall be liable to be declared invalid where, and to the extent that:(a) the trade mark is identical with, or similar to, an earlier national trade mark within the meaning of paragraph 2 and is to he, or has been, registered for goods or services which are not similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is registered, where the earlier trade mark has a reputation in the Member State concerned and where the use of the later trade mark without due cause would take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or che repute of the earlier trade mark;(b) rights to a non-registered trade mark or to another sign used in the course oftrade were acquired prior to the date of application for registration of the subsequent trade mark, or the date of the priority claimed for the application for registration of the subsequent trade mark and that non-registered trade mark or other sign confers on its proprietor the right to prohibit the use of a subsequent trade mark;(c) the use of the trade mark may be prohibited by virtue of an earlier right other than the rights referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 (b) and in particular:(i) a right to a name;(ii) a right of personal portrayal:(iii) a copyright;(iv) an industrial property right;(d) the trade mark is identical with, or similar to, an earlier collective trade mark conferring a right which expired within a period of a maximum of three years preceding application;(e) the trade mark is identical with, or similar to, an earlier guarantee or certification mark conferring a right which expired within a period preceding application the length of which is fixed by the Member State;(f) the trade mark is identical with, or similar to, an earlier trade mark which was registered for identical or similar goods or services and conferred on them a right which has expired for failure to renew within a period of a maximum of two years preceding application, unless the proprietor of the earlier trade mark gave his agreement for the registration of the later mark or did not use his trade mark;(g) the trade mark is liable to be confused with a mark which was in use abroad on the filing date of the application and which is still in use there, provided that at the date of the application the applicant was acting in bad faith?5. The Member States may permit that in appropriate circumstances registration need not be refused or the trade mark need not be declared invalid where the proprietor of the earlier trade mark or other earlier right consents to the registration of the later trade mark.6. Any Member State may provide that, by derogation from paragraphs 1 to S, the grounds for refusal of registration or invalidity in force in that State prior to the date on which the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive enter into force, shall apply to trade marks for which application has been made prior to that date.Article 5Rights conferred by a trade mark1. The registered trade mark shall confer on the proprietor exclusive rights therein. The proprietor shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his consent from using in the course of trade:(a) any sign which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the trade mark is registered;(b) any sign where, because of its identity with, or similarity to, the trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade mark and the sign, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, which includes the likelihood of association between the sign and the trade mark.2. Any Member State may also provide that the proprietor shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his consent from using in the course of trade any sign which is identical with, or similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the trade mark is registered, where the latter has a reputation in the Member State and where use of that sign without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the trade mark.3. The following, inter alia, may be prohibited under paragraphsl and 2:(a) affixing the sign to the goods or to the packaging thereof;(b) offering the goods, or putting them on the market or stocking them for these purposes under that sign, or offering or supplying services thereunder;(c) importing or exporting the goods under the sign;(d) using the sign on business papers and in advertising.4. Where, under the law of the Member State, the use of a sign under the conditions referred to in 1 (b) or 2 could not be prohibited before the date on which the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive entered into force in the Member State concerned, the rights conferred by the trade mark may not be relied on to prevent the continued use of the sign.5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not affect provisions in any Member State relating to the protection against the use of a sign other than for the purposes of distinguishing goods or services, where use of that sign without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the trade markArticle 6Limitation of the effects of a trade mark1. The trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade,(a) his own name or address;(h) indications concerning the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of the service, or other characteristics of goods or services;(c) the trade mark where it is necessary to indicate the intended purposeofa product or service, in particular as accessories or spare parts;provided he uses them in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters2. The trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade, an earlier right which only applies in a particular locality if that right is recognized by the laws of the Member State in question and within the limits of the territory in which it is recognized.Article 7Exhaustion of the rights conferred by a trade mark1. The trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit its use in relation to goods which have been put on the market in the Community under that trade mark by the proprietor or with his consent.2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where there exist legitimate reasons for the proprietor to oppose further commercialization of the goods, especially where the condition of the goods is changed or impaired after they have been put on the market.Article 8Licensingl. A trade mark may be licensed for some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered and for the whole or part of the Member State concerned. A license may be exclusive or non-exclusive.2. The proprietor of a trade mark may invoke the rights conferred by that trade mark against a licensee who contravenes any provision in his licensing contract with regard to its duration, the form covered by the registration in which the trade mark may be used, the scope of the goods or services for which the licence is granted, the territory in which the trade mark may be affixed, or the quality of the goods manufactured or of the services provided by the licensee.Article 9Limitation in consequence of acquiescence1. Where, in a Member State, the proprietor of an earlier trade mark as referred to in Article 4 (2) has acquiesced, for a period of five successive years, irt the use of a later trade mark registered in that Member State while being aware of such use, he shall no longer be entitled on the basis of the earlier trade mark either to apply for a declaration that the later trade mark is invalid or to oppose the use of the later trade mark in respect of the goods or services for which the later trade mark has been used, unless registration of the later trade mark was applied for in bad faith.2. Any Member State may provide that paragraph 1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the proprietor of an earlier trade mark referred to in Article 4 (4) (a) or an other earlier right referred to in Article 4 (4) (b) or (c).3. In the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the proprietor of a later registered trade mark shall not be entitled to oppose the use of the earlier right, even though that right may no longer be invoked against the later trade mark.Article 10Use of trade marks1. If, within a period of five years following the date of the completion of the registration procedure, the proprietor has not put the trade mark to genuine use in the Member State in connection with the goods or services in respect of which it is registered, or if such use has been suspended during an uninterrupted period of five years, the trade mark shall be subject to the sanctions provided for in this Directive, unless there are proper reasons for non-use.2. The following shall also constitute use within the meaning of paragraph 1:(a) use of the trade mark in a form differing in elements which do not alter the distinctive character of the mark in the form in which it was registered;(b) affixing of the trade mark to goods or to the packaging thereof in the Member State concerned solely for export purposes.3. Use of the trade mark with the consent of the proprietor or by any person who has authority to use a collective mark or a guarantee or certification mark shall be deemed to constitute use by the proprietor.4. In relation to trade marks registered before the date on which the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive enter into force in the Member State concerned:(a) where a provision in force prior to that date attaches sanctions to non-use of a trade mark during an uninterrupted period, the relevant period of five years mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be deemed to have begun to run at the same time as any period of non-use which is already running at that date;(b) where there is no use provision in force prior to that date, the periods of five years mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be deemed to run from that date at the earliest.Article 11Sanctions for non use of a trade mark in legal or administrative proceedings1. A trade mark may not be declared invalid on the ground that there is an earlier conflicting trade mark if the latter does not fulfil the requirements of use set out in Article 10 (1), (2) and (3) or in Article 10 (4), as the case may be.2. Any Member State may provide that registration of a trade mark may not be refused on the ground that there is an earlier conflicting trade mark if the latter does not fulfil the requirements of use set out in Article 10 (1), (2) and (3) or in Article 10 (4), as the case may be.3. Without prejudice to the application of Article 12, where a counter-claim for revocation is made, any Member State may provide that a trade mark may not be successfully invoked in infringement proceedings if it is established as a result of a plea that the trade mark could be revoked pursuant to Article 12 (1 ).4. If the earlier trade mark has been used in relation to part only of the goods or services for which it is registered, it shall, for purposes of applying paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, be deemed to be registered in respect only of that part of the goods or services.Article 12Grounds for revocation1. A trade mark shall be liable to revocation if, within a continous period of five years, it has not been put to genuine use in the Member State in connection with the goods or.services in respect of which it is registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-use; however, no person may claim that the proprietor's rights in a trade mark should be revoked where, during the interval between expiry of the five-year period and filing of the application for revocation, genuine use of the trade mark has been started or resumed; the commencement or resumption of use within a period of three months preceding the filing of the application for revocation which began at the earliest on expiry of the continuous period of five years of non-use, shall, however, be disregarded where preparations for the commencement or resumption occur only after the proprietor becomes aware that the application for revocation may be filed.2. A trade mark shall also be liable to revocation if, after the date on which it was registered,(a) in consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor, it has become the common name in the trade for a product or service in respect of which it is registered;(b) in consequence of the use made of it by the proprietor of the trade mark or with his consent in respect of the goods or services for which it is registered, it is liable to mislead the public, particularly as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of those goods or services.Article 13Grounds for refusal or revocation or invalidity relating to only some of the goods or servicesWhere grounds for refusal of registration or for revocation or invalidity of a trade mark exist in respect of only some of the goods or services for which that trade mark has been applied for or registered, refusal of registration or revocation or invalidity shall cover those goods or services only.Article 14Estab1ishment a posteriori of invalidity or revocation of a trade markWhere the seniority of an earlier trade mark which has been surrendered or allowed to lapse, is claimed for a Community trade mark, the invalidity or revocation of the earlier trade mark may be established a posterioriArticle 15Special provisions in respect of collective marks, guarantee marks and certification marks1. Without prejudice to Article 4, Member States whose laws authorize the registration of collective marks or of.guarantee or certification marks may provide that such marks shall not be registered, or shall be revoked or declared invalid, on grounds additional to those specified in Articles 3 and 12 where the function of those marks so requires.2.

The following shall be treated in the same way as a diploma, within the meaning of the first subparagraph: any diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications or any set of such diplomas, certificates or other evidence awarded by a competent authority in a Member State if it is awarded on the successful completion of education and training received in the Community and recognized by a competent authority in that Member State as being of an equivalent level and if it confers the same rights in respect of the taking up and pursuit of a regulated profession in that Member State; (b) host Member State: any Member State in which a national of a Member State applies to pursue a profession subject to regulation in that Member State, other than the State in which he obtained his diploma or first pursued the profession in question; (c) a regulated profession: the regulated professional activity or range of activities which constitute this profession in a Member State; (d) regulated professional activity: a professional activity, in so far as the taking up or pursuit of such activity or one of its modes of pursuit in a Member State is subject, directly or indirectly by virtue of laws, regulations or administrative provisions, to the possession of a diploma. The following in particular shall constitute a mode of pursuit of a regulated professional activity: - pursuit of an activity under a professional title, in so far as the use of such a title is reserved to the holders of a diploma governed by laws, regulations or administrative provisions, - pursuit of a professional activity relating to health, in so far as remuneration and/or reimbursement for such an activity is subject by virtue of national social security arrangements to the possession of a diploma. Where the first subparagraph does not apply, a professional activity shall be deemed to be a regulated professional activity if it is pursued by the members of an association or organization the purpose of which is, in particular, to promote and maintain a high standard in the professional field concerned and which, to achieve that purpose, is recognized in a special form by a Member State and: - awards a diploma to its members, - ensures that its members respect the rules of professional conduct which it prescribes, and - confers on them the right to use a title or designatory letters, or to benefit from a status corresponding to that diploma. A non-exhaustive list of associations or organizations which, when this Directive is adopted, satisfy the conditions of the second subparagraph is contained in the Annex. Whenever a Member State grants the recognition referred to in the second subparagraph to an association or organization, it shall inform the Commission thereof, which shall publish this information in the Official Journal of the European Communities. (e) professional experience: the actual and lawful pursuit of the profession concerned in a Member State; (f) adaptation period: the pursuit of a regulated profession in the host Member State under the responsibility of a qualified member of that profession, such period of supervised practice possibly being accompanied by further training. This period of supervised practice shall be the subject of an assessment. The detailed rules governing the adaptation period and its assessment as well as the status of a migrant person under supervision shall be laid down by the competent authority in the host Member States; (g) aptitude test: a test limited to the professional knowledge of the applicant, made by the competent authorities of the host Member State with the aim of assessing the ability of the applicant to pursue a regulated profession in that Member State. In order to permit this test to be carried out, the competent authorities shall draw up a list of subjects which, on the basis of a comparison of the education and training required in the Member State and that received by the applicant, are not covered by the diploma or other evidence of formal qualifications possessed by the applicant. The aptitude test must take account of the fact that the applicant is a qualified professional in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which he comes. It shall cover subjects to be selected from those on the list, knowledge of which is essential in order to be able to exercise the profession in the host Member State. The test may also include knowledge of the professional rules applicable to the activities in question in the host Member State. The detailed application of the aptitude test shall be determined by the competent authorities of that State with due regard to the rules of Community law. The status, in the host Member State, of the applicant who wishes to prepare himself for the aptitude test in that State shall be determined by the competent authorities in that State. Article 2 This Directive shall apply to any national of a Member State wishing to pursue a regulated profession in a host Member State in a self-employed capacity or as an employed person. This Directive shall not apply to professions which are the subject of a separate Directive establishing arrangements for the mutual recognition of diplomas by Member States.

Article 3 Where, in a host Member State, the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject to possession of a diploma, the competent authority may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to authorize a national of a Member State to take up or pursue that profession on the same conditions as apply to its own nationals: (a) if the applicant holds the diploma required in another Member State for the taking up or pursuit of the profession in question in its territory, such diploma having been awarded in a Member State; or (b) if the applicant has pursued the profession in question full-time for two years during the previous ten years in another Member State which does not regulate that profession, within the meaning of Article 1 (c) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (d), and possesses evidence of one or more formal qualifications: - which have been awarded by a competent authority in a Member State, designated in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of such State, - which show that the holder has successfully completed a post-secondary course of at least three years' duration, or of an equivalent duration part-time, at a university or establishment of higher education or another establishment of similar level of a Member State and, where appropriate, that he has successfully completed the professional training required in addition to the post-secondary course and - which have prepared the holder for the pursuit of his profession. The following shall be trated in the same way as the evidence of formal qualifications referred to in the first subparagraph: any formal qualifications or any set of such formal qualifications awarded by a competent authority in a Member State if it is awarded on the successful completion of training received in the Community and is recognized by that Member State as being of an equivalent level, provided that the other Member States and the Commission have been notified of this recognition. Article 4 1. Notwithstanding Article 3, the host Member State may also require the applicant: (a) to provide evidence of professional experience, where the duration of the education and training adduced in support of his application, as laid down in Article 3 (a) and (b), is at least one year less than that required in the host Member State. In this event, the period of professional experience required: - may not exceed twice the shortfall in duration of education and training where the shortfall relates to post-secondary studies and/or to a period of probationary practice carried out under the control of a supervising professional person and ending with an examination, - may not exceed the shortfall where the shortfall relates to professional practice acquired with the assistance of a qualified member of the profession. In the case of diplomas within the meaning of the last subparagraph of Article 1 (a), the duration of education and training recognized as being of an equivalent level shall be determined as for the education and training defined in the first subparagraph of Article 1 (a). When applying these provisions, account must be taken of the professional experience referred to in Article 3 (b). At all events, the professional experience required may not exceed four years; (b) to complete an adaptation period not exceeding three years or take an aptitude test: - where the matters covered by the education and training he has received as laid down in Article 3 (a) and (b), differ substantially from those covered by the diploma required in the host Member State, or - where, in the case referred to in Article 3 (a), the profession regulated in the host Member State comprises one or more regulated professional activities which are not in the profession regulated in the Member State from which the applicant originates or comes and that difference corresponds to specific education and training required in the host Member State and covers matters which differ substantially from those covered by the diploma adduced by the applicant, or - where, in the case referred to in Article 3 (b), the profession regulated in the host Member State comprises one or more regulated professional activities which are not in the profession pursued by the applicant in the Member State from which he originates or comes, and that difference corresponds to specific education and training required in the host Member State and covers matters which differ substantially from those covered by the evidence of formal qualifications adduced by the applicant. Should the host Member State make use of this possibility, it must give the applicant the right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test. By way of derogation from this principle, for professions whose practice requires precise knowledge of national law and in respect of which the provision of advice and/or assistance concerning national law is an essential and constant aspect of the professional activity, the host Member State may stipulate either an adaptation period or an aptitude test. Where the host Member State intends to introduce derogations for other professions as regards an applicant's right to choose, the procedure laid down in Article 10 shall apply. 2. However, the host Member State may not apply the provisions of paragraph 1 (a) and (b) cumulatively. Article 5 Without prejudice to Articles 3 and 4, a host Member State may allow the applicant, with a view to improving his possibilities of adapting to the professional environment in that State, to undergo there, on the basis of equivalence, that part of his professional education and training represented by professional practice, acquired with the assistance of a qualified member of the profession, which he has not undergone in his Member State of origin or the Member State from which he has come. Article 6 1. Where the competent authority of a host Member State requires of persons wishing to take up a regulated profession proof that they are of good character or repute or that they have not been declared bankrupt, or suspends or prohibits the pursuit of that profession in the event of serious professional misconduct or a criminal offence, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of Member States wishing to pursue that profession in its territory, the production of documents issued by competent authorities in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes showing that those requirements are met. Where the competent authorities of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes do not issue the documents referred to in the first subparagraph, such documents shall be replaced by a declaration on oath - or, in States where there is no provision for declaration on oath, by a solemn declaration - made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority or, where appropriate, a notary or qualified professional body of the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the person comes; such authority or notary shall issue a certificate attesting the authenticity of the declaration on oath or solemn declaration. 2. Where the competent authority of a host Member State requires of nationals of that Member State wishing to take up or pursue a regulated profession a certificate of physical or mental health, that authority shall accept as sufficient evidence in this respect the production of the document required in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes. Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not impose any requirements of this nature on those wishing to take up or pursue the profession in question, the host Member State shall accept from such nationals a certificate issued by a competent authority in that State corresponding to the certificates issued in the host Member State. 3. The competent authorities of host Member States may require that the documents and certificates referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 are presented no more than three months after their date of issue. 4. Where the competent authority of a host Member State requires nationals of that Member State wishing to take up or pursue a regulated profession to take an oath or make a solemn declaration and where the form of such oath or declaration cannot be used by nationals of other Member States, that authority shall ensure that an appropriate and equivalent form of oath or declaration is offered to the person concerned. Article 7 1. The competent authorities of host Member States shall recognize the right of nationals of Member States who fulfil the conditions for the taking up and pursuit of a regulated profession in their territory to use the professional title of the host Member State corresponding to that profession. 2. The competent authorities of host Member States shall recognize the right of nationals of Member States who fulfil the conditions for the taking up and pursuit of a regulated profession in their territory to use their lawful academic title and, where appropriate, the abbreviation thereof deriving from their Member State of origin or the Member State from which they come, in the language of that State. Host Member State may require this title to be followed by the name and location of the establishment or examining board which awarded it. 3. Where a profession is regulated in the host Member State by an association or organization referred to in Article 1 (d), nationals of Member States shall only be entitled to use the professional title or designatory letters conferred by that organization or association on proof of membership. Where the association or organization makes membership subject to certain qualification requirements, it may apply these to nationals of other Member States who are in possession of a diploma within the meaning of Article 1 (a) or a formal qualification within the meaning of Article 3 (b) only in accordance with this Directive, in particular Articles 3 and 4. Article 8 1. The host Member State shall accept as proof that the conditions laid down in Articles 3 and 4 are satisfied the certificates and documents issued by the competent authorities in the Member States, which the person concerned shall submit in support of his application to pursue the profession concerned. 2. The procedure for examining an application to pursue a regulated profession shall be completed as soon as possible and the outcome communicated in a reasoned decision of the competent authority in the host Member State not later than four months after presentation of all the documents relating to the person concerned. A remedy shall be available against this decision, or the absence thereof, before a court or tribunal in accordance with the provisions of national law. Article 9 1. Member States shall designate, within the period provided for in Article 12, the competent authorities empowered to receive the applications and take the decisions referred to in this Directive. They shall communicate this information to the other Member States and to the Commission. 2. Each Member State shall designate a person responsible for coordinating the activities of the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 and shall inform the other Member States and the Commission to that effect. His role shall be to promote uniform application of this Directive to all the professions concerned. A coordinating group shall be set up under the aegis of the Commission, composed of the coordinators appointed by each Member State or their deputies and chaired by a representative of the Commission. The task of this group shall be: - to facilitate the implementation of this Directive, - to collect all useful information for its application in the Member States. The group may be consulted by the Commission on any changes to the existing system that may contemplated. 3. Member States shall take measures to provide the necessary information on the recognition of diplomas within the framework of this Directive. They may be assisted in this task by the information centre on the academic recognition of diplomas and periods of study established by the Member States within the framework of the Resolution of the Council and the Ministers of Education meeting within the Council of 9 February 1976 (1), and, where appropriate, the relevant professional associations or organizations. The Commission shall take the necessary initiatives to ensure the development and coordination of the communication of the necessary information. Article 10 1. If, pursuant to the third sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 4 (1) (b), a Member State proposes not to grant applicants the right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test in respect of a profession within the meaning of this Directive, it shall immediately communicate to the Commission the corresponding draft provision. It shall at the same time notify the Commission of the grounds which make the enactment of such a provision necessary. The Commission shall immediately notify the other Member States of any draft it has received; it may also consult the coordinating group referred to in Article 9 (2) of the draft. 2. Without prejudice to the possibility for the Commission and the other Member States of making comments on the draft, the Member State may adopt the provision only if the Commission has not taken a decision to the contrary within three months. 3. At the request of a Member State or the Commission, Member States shall communicate to them, without delay, the definitive text of a provision arising from the application of this Article. Article 11 Following the expiry of the period provided for in Article 12, Member States shall communicate to the Commission, every two years, a report on the application of the system introduced. In addition to general remarks, this report shall contain a statistical summary of the decisions taken and a description of the main problems arising from application of the Directive. Article 12 Member States shall take the measures neccessary to comply with this Directive within two years of its notification (2). They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive. Article 13 Five years at the latest following the date specified in Article 12, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and the Council on the state of application of the general system for the recognition of higher-education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration. After conducting all necessary consultations, the Commission shall, on this occasion, present its conclusions as to any changes that need to be made to the system as it stands. At the same time the Commission shall, where appropriate, submit proposals for improvements in the present system in the interest of further facilitating the freedom of movement, right of establishment and freedom to provide services of the persons covered by this Directive.

"16","31988L0361","Article 1 1. Without prejudice to the following provisions, Member States shall abolish restrictions on movements of capital taking place between persons resident in Member States. To facilitate application of this Directive, capital movements shall be classified in accordance with the Nomenclature in Annex I. 2. Transfers in respect of capital movements shall be made on the same exchange rate conditions as those governing payments relating to current transactions. Article 2 Member States shall notify the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks, the Monetary Committee and the Commission, by the date of their entry into force at the latest, of measures to regulate bank liquidity which have a specific impact on capital transactions carried out by credit institutions with non-residents. Such measures shall be confined to what is necessary for the purposes of domestic monetary regulation. The Monetary Committee and the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks shall provide the Commission with opinions on this subject. Article 3 1. Where short-term capital movements of exceptional magnitude impose severe strains on foreign-exchange markets and lead to serious disturbances in the conduct of a Member State's monetary and exchange rate policies, being reflected in particular in substantial variations in domestic liquidity, the Commission may, after consulting the Monetary Committee and the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks, authorize that Member State to take, in respect of the capital movements listed in Annex II, protective measures the conditions and details of which the Commission shall determine. 2. The Member State concerned may itself take the protective measures referred to above, on grounds of urgency, should these measures be necessary. The Commission and the other Member States shall be informed of such measures by the date of their entry into force at the latest. The Commission, after consulting the Monetary Committee and the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks, shall decide whether the Member State concerned may continue to apply these measures or whether it should amend or abolish them. 3. The decisions taken by the Commission under paragraphs 1 and 2 may be revoked or amended by the Council acting by a qualified majority. 4. The period of application of protective measures taken pursuant to this Article shall not exceed six months. 5. Before 31 December 1992, the Council shall examine, on the basis of a report from the Commission, after delivery of an opinion by the Monetary Committee and the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks, whether the provisions of this Article remain appropriate, as regards their principle and details, to the requirements which they were intended to satisfy. Article 4 This Directive shall be without prejudice to the right of Member States to take all requisite measures to prevent infringements of their laws and regulations, inter alia in the field of taxation and prudential supervision of financial institutions, or to lay down procedures for the declaration of capital movements for purposes of administrative or statistical information. Application of those measures and procedures may not have the effect of impeding capital movements carried out in accordance with Community law. Article 5 For the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic, the scope, in accordance with the Nomenclature of capital movements contained in Annex I, of the provisions of the 1985 Act of Accession in the field of capital movements shall be as indicated in Annex III. Article 6 1. Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive no later than 1 July 1990. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. They shall also make known, by the date of their entry into force at the latest, any new measure or any amendment made to the provisions governing the capital movements listed in Annex I. 2. The Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic, without prejudice for these two Member States to Articles 61 to 66 and 222 to 232 of the 1985 Act of Accession, and the Hellenic Republic and Ireland may temporarily continue to apply restrictions to the capital movements listed in Annex IV, subject to the conditions and time limits laid down in that Annex. If, before expiry of the time limit set for the liberalization of the capital movements referred to in Lists III and IV of Annex IV, the Portuguese Republic or the Hellenic Republic considers that it is unable to proceed with liberalization, in particular because of difficulties as regards its balance of payments or because the national financial system is insufficiently adapted, the Commission, at the request of one or other of these Member States, shall in collaboration with the Monetary Committee, review the economic and financial situation of the Member State concerned. On the basis of the outcome of this review, the Commission shall propose to the Council an extension of the time limit set for liberalization of all or part of the capital movements referred to. This extension may not exceed three years. The Council shall act in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 69 of the Treaty. 3. The Kingdom of Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may temporarily continue to operate the dual exchange market under the conditions and for the periods laid down in Annex V. 4. Existing national legislation regulating purchases of secondary residences may be upheld until the Council adopts further provisions in this area in accordance with Article 69 of the Treaty. This provision does not affect the applicability of other provisions of Community law. 5. The Commission shall submit to the Council, by 31 December 1988, proposals aimed at eliminating or reducing risks of distortion, tax evasion and tax avoidance linked to the diversity of national systems for the taxation of savings and for controlling the application of these systems. The Council shall take a position on these Commission proposals by 30 June 1989. Any tax provisions of a Community nature shall, in accordance with the Treaty, be adopted unanimously. Article 7 1. In their treatment of transfers in respect of movements of capital to or from third countries, the Member States shall endeavour to attain the same degree of liberalization as that which applies to operations with residents of other Member States, subject to the other provisions of this Directive. The provisions of the preceding subparagraph shall not prejudice the application to third countries of domestic rules or Community law, particularly any reciprocal conditions, concerning operations involving establishment, the provisions of financial services and the admission of securities to capital markets. 2. Where large-scale short-term capital movements to or from third countries seriously disturb the domestic or external monetary or financial situation of the Member States, or of a number of them, or cause serious strains in exchange relations within the Community or between the Community and third countries, Member States shall consult with one another on any measure to be taken to counteract such difficulties. This consultation shall take place within the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks and the Monetary Committee on the initiative of the Commission or of any Member State. Article 8 At least once a year the Monetary Committee shall examine the situation regarding free movement of capital as it results from the application of this Directive. The examination shall cover measures concerning the domestic regulation of credit and financial and monetary markets which could have a specific impact on international capital movements and on all other aspects of this Directive. The Committee shall report to the Commission on the outcome of this examination. Article 9 The First Directive of 11 May 1960 and Directive 72/156/EEC shall be repealed with effect from 1 July 1990.

"18","31986L0613","SECTION I Aims and scope Article 1 The purpose of this Directive is to ensure, in accordance with the following provisions, application in the Member States of the principle of equal treatment as between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity, or contributing to the pursuit of such an activity, as regards those aspects not covered by Directives 76/207/EEC and 79/7/EEC. Article 2 This Directive covers: (a) self-employed workers, i.e. all persons pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law, including farmers and members of the liberal professions; (b) their spouses, not being employees or partners, where they habitually, under the conditions laid down by national law, participate in the activities of the self-employed worker and perform the same tasks or ancillary tasks. Article 3 For the purposes of this Directive the principle of equal treatment implies the absence of all discrimination on grounds of sex, either directly or indirectly, by reference in particular to marital or family status. SECTION II Equal treatment between self-employed male and female workers - position of the spouses without professional status of self-employed workers - protection of self-employed workers or wives of self-employed workers during pregnancy and motherhood Article 4 As regards self-employed persons, Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure the elimination of all provisions which are contrary to the principle of equal treatment as defined in Directive 76/207/EEC, especially in respect of the establishment, equipment or extension of a business or the launching or extension of any other form of self-employed activity including financial facilities. Article 5 Without prejudice to the specific conditions for access to certain activities which apply equally to both sexes, Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the conditions for the formation of a company between spouses are not more restrictive than the conditions for the formation of a company between unmarried persons. Article 6 Where a contributory social security system for selfemployed workers exists in a Member State, that Member State shall take the necessary measures to enable the spouses referred to in Article 2 (b) who are not protected under the self-employed worker's social security scheme to join a contributory social security scheme voluntarily. Article 7 Member States shall undertake to examine under what conditions recognition of the work of the spouses referred to in Article 2 (b) may be encouraged and, in the light of such examination, consider any appropriate steps for encouraging such recognition. Article 8 Member States shall undertake to examine whether, and under what conditions, female self-employed workers and the wives of self-employed workers may, during interruptions in their occupaional activity owing to pregnancy or motherhood, - have access to services supplying temporary replacements or existing national social services, or - be entitled to cash benefits under a social security scheme or under any other public social protection system.

"19","31986L0378","Article 1 The object of this Directive is to implement, in occupational social security schemes, the principle of equal treatment for men and women, hereinafter referred to as 'the principle of equal treatment'. Article 2 1. 'Occupational social security schemes' means schemes not governed by Directive 79/7/EEC whose purpose is to provide workers, whether employees or self-employed, in an undertaking or group of undertakings, area of economic activity or occupational sector or group of such sectors with benefits intended to supplement the benefits provided by statutory social security schemes or to replace them, whether membership of such schemes is compulsory or optional. 2. This Directive does not apply to: (a) individual contracts, (b) schemes having only one member, (c) in the case of salaried workers, insurance schemes offered to participants individually to guarantee them: - either additional benefits, or - a choice of date on which the normal benefits will start, or a choice between several benefits. Article 3 This Directive shall apply to members of the working population including self-employed persons, persons whose activity is interrupted by illness, matrnity, accident or involuntary unemployment and persons seeking employment, and to retired and disabled workers. Article 4 This Directive shall apply to: (a) occupational schemes which provide protection against the following risks: - sickness, - invalidity, - old age, including early retirement, - industrial accidents and occupational diseases, - unemployment; (b) occupational schemes which provide for other social benefits, in cash or in kind, and in particular survivors' benefits and family allowances, if such benefits are accorded to employed persons and thus constitute a consideration paid by the employer to the worker by reason of the latter's employment. Article 5 1. Unter the conditions laid down in the following provisions, the principle of equal treatment implies that there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex, either directly or indirectly, by reference in particular to marital or family status, especially as regards: - the scope of the schemes and the conditions of access to them; - the obligation to contribute and the calculation of contributions; - the calculation of benefits, including supplementary benefits due in respect of a spouse or dependants, and the conditions governing the duration and retention of entitlement to benefits. 2. The principle of equal treatment shall not prejudice the provisions relating to the protection of women by reason of maternity. Article 6 1. Provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment shall include those based on sex, either directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to marital or family for: (a) determining the persons who may participate in an occupational scheme; (b) fixing the compulsory or optional nature of participation in an occupational scheme; (c) laying down different rules as regards the age of entry into the scheme or the minimum period of employment or membership of the scheme required to obtain the benefits thereof; (d) laying down different rules, except as provided for in subparagraphs (h) and (i), for the reimbursement of contributions where a worker leaves a scheme without having fulfilled the conditions guaranteeing him a deferred right to long-term benefits; (e) setting different conditions for the granting of benefits of restricting such benefits to workers of one or other of the sexes; (f) fixing different retirement ages; (g) suspending the retention or acquisition of rights during periods of maternity leave or leave for family reasons which are granted by law or agreement and are paid by the employer; (h) setting different levels of benefit, except insofar as may be necessary to take account of actuarial calculation factors which differ according to sex in the case of benefits designated as contribution-defined; (i) setting different levels of worker contribution; setting different levels of employer contribution in the case of benefits designated as contribution-defined, except with a view to making the amount of those benefits more nearly equal; (j) laying down different standards or standards applicable only to workers of a specified sex, except as provided for in subparagraphs (h) and (i), as regards the guarantee or retention of entitlement to deferred benefits when a worker leaves a scheme. 2. Where the granting of benefits within the scope of this Directive is left to the discretion of the scheme's management bodies, the latter must take account of the principle of equal treatment. Article 7 Member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that: (a) provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment in legally compulsory collective agreements, staff rules of undertakings or any other arrangements relating to occupational schemes are null and void, or may be declared null and void or amended; (b) schemes containing such provisions may not be approved or extended by administrative measures. Article 8 1. Member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the provisions of occupational schemes contrary to the principle of equal treatment are revised by 1 January 1993. 2. This Directive shall not preclude rights and obligations relating to a period of membership of an occupational scheme prior to revision of that scheme from remaining subject to the provisions of the scheme in force during that period. Article 9 Member States may defer compulsory application of the principle of equal treatment with regard to: (a) determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old-age or retirement pensions, and the possible implications for other benefits: - either until the date on which such equality is achieved in statutory schemes, - or, at the latest, until such equality is required by a directive. (b) survivors' pensions until a directive requires the principle of equal treatment in statutory social security schemes in that regard; (c) the application of the first subparagraph of Article 6 (1) (i) to take account of the different actuarial calculation factors, at the latest until the expiry of a thirteen-year period as from the notification of this Directive. Article 10 Member States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to enable all persons who consider themselves injured by failure to apply the principle of equal treatment to pursue their claims before the courts, possibly after bringing the matters before other competent authorities. Article 11 Member States shall take all the necessary steps to protect worker against dismissal where this constitutes a response on the part of the employer to a complaint made at undertaking level or to the institution of legal proceedings aimed at enforcing compliance with the principle of equal treatment. Article 12 1. Member States shall bring into force such laws, regulations and administrative provisions as are necessary in order to comply with this Directive at the latest three years after notification thereof (1). They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof. 2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission at the latest five years after notification of this Directive all information necessary to enable the Commission to draw up a report on the application of this Directive for submission to the Council.

"20","31985L0432","Article 1 1. Member States shall ensure that holders of a diploma, certificate or other university or equivalent qualification in pharmacy which meets the conditions laid down in Article 2 shall be entitled at least to access to the activities mentioned in paragraph 2 and to pursue such activities subject, where appropriate, to the requirement of additional professional experience. 2. The activities referred to in paragraph 1 are: - the preparation of the pharmaceutical form of medicinal products, - the manufacture and testing of medicinal products, - the testing of medicinal products in a laboratory for the of medicinal of medicinal products, - the storage, preservation and distribution of medicinal products at the wholesale stage, - the preparation, testing, storage and supply of medicinal products in pharmacies open to the public, - the preparation, testing, storage and dispensing of medicinal products in hospitals, - the provisions of information and advice on medicinal products. 3. Where at the time of adoption of this Directive a system of competition based on tests exists in a Member State for the purpose of selecting from among the holders referred to in paragraph 1 those to be appointed to control the new pharmacies to be set up under a national geographical distribution system, that Member State may, by way of derogation from paragraph 1, retain this competition system and may oblige nationals of the Member States holding the diplomas, certificates and other formal qualifications in pharmacy referred to in Article 2 (1) and Article 6 of Directive 85/433/EEC to take part in such a competition. Article 2 Member States shall subordinate the award of the diplomas, certificates and other formal qualifications referred to in Article 1 to the following minimum conditions: 1. Training leading to the award of the diploma, certificate or other formal qualification shall ensure: (a) adequate knowledge of medicines and the substances used in the manufacture of medicines; (b) adequate knowledge of pharmaceutical technology and the physical, chemical, biological and microbiological testing of medicinal products; (c) adequate knowledge of the metabolism and the effects of medicinal products and of the action of toxic substances, and of the use of medicinal products; (d) adequate knowledge to evaluate scientific data concerning medicines in order to be able to supply appropriate information on the basis of this knowledge; (e) adequate knowledge of the legal and other requirements associated with the practice of pharmacy. 2. In order to be accepted for such training, the candidate must have a diploma or a certificate which entitles him to be admitted for the course of study concerned to the universities of a Member State or to higher education institutions recognized as having equivalent status. 3. The diploma, certificate or other formal qualification shall testify to the completion of a course of training covering a period of at least five years and comprising: - at least four years of full-time theoretical and practical training in a university, in a higher education institution of a level recognized as having equivalent status, or under the supervision of a university, - at least six months of in-service training in a pharmacy open to the public or in a hospital under the supervision of the pharamaceutical department of that hospital. 4. By way of derogation from point 3: (a) if at the time of the adoption of this Directive two courses of training coexist in a Member State, one of which lasts five years and the other four years, the diploma, certificate or other formal qualification testifying to the completion of the four-year course of training, shall be considered to fulfil the condition concerning duration referred to in point 3 provided that the diplomas, certificates or other formal qualifications testifying to the completion of the two courses of training are recognized as equivalent by that State; (b) if, because, there are insufficient places in pharmacies open to the public and in hospitals near training establishments, a Member State is unable to provide six months of in-service training, it may, for a period of five years following the expiry of the time limit laid down in Article 5, make provision for no more than half of that training period to involve activities as a pharmacist in an undertaking which manufactures medicinal products. 5. The course of training referred to in point 3 shall comprise as a minimum theoretical and practical training in the following subjects: - Plant and animal biology, - Physics, - General and inorganic chemistry, - Organic chemistry, - Analytical chemistry, - Pharmaceutical chemistry, including analysis of medicinal products, - General and applied biochemistry (medical), - Anatomy and physiology; medical terminology, - Microbiology, - Pharmacology and pharmacotherapy, - Pharmaceutical technology, - Toxicology, - Pharmacognosy, - Legislation and, where appropriate, professional ethics.

"21","31985L0384","title of architect; Whereas acquisition of the lawful professional title of architect is subject in some Member States to completion of a period of practical experience in addition to the possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications; whereas, since practice in this respect of present varies from one Member State to another, to obviate possible difficulties completion of an equal period of appropriate practical experience in another Member State should be recognized as meeting this condition; Whereas the reference in Article 1 (2) to 'activities in the field of architecture' as being 'those activities usually pursued under the professional title of architect', the justification for which lies in the conditions prevailing in certain Member States, is intended solely to indicate the scope of this Directive, without claiming to give a legal definition of activities in the field of architecture; Whereas, in most Member States, activities in the field of architecture are pursued, in law or in fact, by persons who hold the title of architect, whether alone or together with another title, without those persons having a monopoly in pursuing those activities save where there are laws to the contrary; whereas the aforementioned activities, or some of them, may also be pursued by members of other professions, in particular by engineers who have received special training in construction engineering or building; Whereas the mutual recognition of qualifications will facilitate the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question; Whereas in some Member States there is legislation allowing the lawful professional title of architect, by way of exception and notwithstanding the usual educational and training requirements for access to the title, to be granted to certain distinguished persons in the field, who are very few in number and whose work shows exceptional architectural talent; whereas the case of these architects should be covered in this Directive, particularly since they frequently enjoy an international reputation; Whereas the recognition of a number of the existing diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in architecture listed in Articles 10 to 12 is intended to enable the holders thereof to establish themselves or provide services in other Member States with immediate effect; whereas the sudden introduction of this provision in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg could, in view of the country's small size, lead to distortion of competition and disturb the organization of the profession; whereas, as a result, there appears to be justification for allowing this Member State an additiional period of adjustment; Whereas, since a Directive on the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in architecture does not necessarily imply practical equivalence in the education and training covered by such diplomas, certificates and evidence, the use of titles should be authorized only in the language of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which a foreign national comes; Whereas, to facilitate the application of this Directive by the national authorities, Member States may prescribe that, in addition to evidence of qualifications, persons who satisfy the educational and training requirements of this Directive must provide a certificate from the competent authorities of their Member State of origin or of the country from which they come stating that these qualifications are those referred to by the Directive; Whereas the national provisions with regard to good repute and good character may be applied as standards for the taking up of activities if establishment takes place; whereas, moreover, in the circumstances a distinction should be drawn between cases in which the persons concerned have never yet exercised any activities in the field of architecture and those in which they have already exercised such activities in another Member State; Whereas, in the case of the provision of services, the requirement of registration with, or membership of, professional organizations or bodies would, since it is related to the fixed and permanent nature of the activity pursued in the host Member State, undoubtedly constitute an obstacle to the provider of services by reason of the temporary nature of his activity; whereas this requirement should therefore be abolished; whereas, however, in this event control over professional discipline, which is the responsibility of these professional organizations or bodies, should be guaranteed; whereas, to this end, it should be provided, subject to the application of Article 62 of the Treaty, that the person concerned may be required to notify the provision of services to the competent authority of the host Member State; Whereas, as far as the activities of employed persons in the field of architecture are concerned, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (1) lays down no specific provisions relating to good character or good repute, professional discipline or use of title for the professions covered; whereas, depending on the individual Member State, such rules are or may be applicable both to employed and to self-employed persons; whereas activities in the field of architecture are subject in several Member States to possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications; whereas such activities are pursued by both employed and self-employed persons, or by the same persons in both capacities in the course of their professional career; whereas, in order to encourage fully the free movement of members of the profession within the Community, it therefore appears necessary to extend this Directive to employed persons in the field of architecture; Whereas this Directive introduces mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications giving access to professional activities, without concomitant coordination of national provisions relating to education and training; whereas, moreover, the number of members of the profession who are concerned varies considerably from one Member State to another; whereas the first few years of application of this Directive must therefore be followed particularly attentively by the Commission, HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: CHAPTER I SCOPE Article 1 1. This Directive shall apply to activities in the field of architecture. 2. For the purposes of this Directive, activities in the field of architecture shall be those activities usually pursued under the professional title of architect. CHAPTER II DIPLOMAS, CERTIFICATES AND OTHER EVIDENCE OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS ENABLING THE HOLDER TO TAKE UP ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD OF ARCHITECTURE UNDER THE PROFESSIONAL TITLE OF ARCHITECT Article 2 Each Member State shall recognize the diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications acquired as a result of education and training fulfilling the requirements of Articles 3 and 4 and awarded to nationals of Member States by other Member States, by giving such diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications, as regards the right to take up activities referred to in Article 1 and pursue them under the professional title of architect pursuant to Article 23 (1), the same effect in its territory as those awarded by the Member State itself. Article 3 Education and training leading to diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications referred to in Article 2 shall be provided through courses of studies at university level concerned principally with architecture. Such studies shall be balanced between the theoretical and practical aspects of architectural training and shall ensure the acquisition of: 1. an ability to create architectural designs that satisfy both aesthetic and technical requirements, 2. an adequate knowledge of the history and theories of architecture and the related arts, technologies and human sciences, 3. a knowledge of the fine arts as an influence on the quality of architectural design, 4. an adequate knowledge of urban design, planning and the skills involved in the planning process, 5. an understanding of the relationship between people and buildings, and between buildings and their environment, and of the need to relate buildings and the spaces between them to human needs and scale, 6. an understanding of the profession of architecture and the role of the architect in society, in particular in preparing briefs that take account of social factors, 7. an understanding of the methods of investigation and preparation of the brief for a design project, 8. an understanding of the structural design, constructional and engineering problems associated with building design, 9. an adequate knowledge of physical problems and technologies and of the function of buildings so as to provide them with internal conditions of comfort and protection against the climate, 10. the necessary design skills to meet building users' requirements within the constraints imposed by cost factors and building regulations, 11. an adequate knowledge of the industries, organizations, regulations and procedures involved in translating design concepts into buildings and integrating plans into overall planning. Article 4 1. The education and training referred to in Article 2 must satisfy the requirements defined in Article 3 and also the following conditions: (a) the total length of education and training shall consist of a minimum of either four years of full-time studies at a university or comparable educational establishment, or at least six years of study at a university or comparable educational establishment of which at least three must be full time; (b) such education and training shall be concluded by successful completion of an examination of degree standard. Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, recognition under Article 2 shall also be accorded to the training given over three years in the 'Fachhochschulen' in the Federal Republic of Germany in the form in which it exists at the time of notification of this Directive and in so far as it satisfies the requirements laid down in Article 3, giving access to the activities referred to in Article 1 in that Member State with the professional title of architect, provided that such training is supplemented by a four-year period of professional experience in the Federal Republic of Germany sanctioned by a certificate issued by the professional body on whose list the architect wishing to benefit from the provisions of this Directive is registered. The body shall previously have established that the work carried out by the architect concerned in the field of architecture constitutes conclusive proof of the practical application of all the knowledge referred to in Article 3. The certificate shall be issued according to the same procedure as that which applies to registration on the list of architects. On the basis of the experience gained and bearing in mind developments in architectural training, the Commission shall, eight years after the end of the period specified in the first subparagraph of Article 31 (1), submit a report to the Council on the application of this derogation and the appropriate proposals on which the Council shall decide in accordance with the procedures laid down by the Treaty within a period of six months. 2. Recognition under Article 2 shall also be accorded to education and training which, as part of a social betterment scheme or a part-time university course, conforms to the requirements of Article 3 and leads to an examination in architecture successfully completed by persons who have been employed in architecture for not less than seven years under the supervision of an architect or firm of architects. This examination must be of degree standard and be equivalent to the final examination referred to in paragraph 1 (b). Article 5 1. Nationals of a Member State authorized to hold the professional title of architect pursuant to a law giving the competent authority of a Member State the possibility of conferring this title on nationals of Member States who have particularly distinguished themselves by their achievements in the field of architecture shall be considered as meeting the requirements laid down for the pursuit of architectural activities under the professional title of architect. 2. In the case of those persons referred to in paragraph 1, a certificate issued by the Member State of which the holder is a national, or from which he comes, shall constitute proof of the status of architect. Article 6 Certificates issued by the competent authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany attesting the equivalence of qualifications awarded after 8 May 1945 by the competent authorities of the German Democratic Republic with the formal qualifications referred to in Article 2 shall be recognized under the conditions laid down in that Article. Article 7 1. Each Member State shall communicate as soon as possible, simultaneously to the other Member States and to the Commission, the list of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications which are awarded within its territory and which meet the criteria laid down in Articles 3 and 4, together with the establishments and authorities awarding them. The first list shall be sent within 12 months of notification of this Directive. Each Member State shall likewise communicate any amendments made as regards the diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications which are awarded within its territory, in particular those which no longer meet the requirements of Articles 3 and 4. 2. For information purposes, the lists and the updating thereof shall be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Communities after expiry of a three-month period following their communication. However, in the cases referred to in Article 8, the publication of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications shall be deferred. Consolidated lists shall be published periodically by the Commission. Article 8 If a Member State or the Commission has doubts as to whether a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications meets the criteria laid down in Articles 3 and 4, the Commission shall bring the matter before the Advisory Committee on Education and Training in the Field of Architecture within three months of communication pursuant to Article 7 (1). The Committee shall deliver its opinion within three months. The diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications shall be published within the three months following delivery of the opinion or expiry of the deadline for delivery thereof except in the following two cases: - where the awarding Member State amends the communication made pursuant to Article 7 (1) or - where a Member State or the Commission implements Articles 169 or 170 of the Treaty with a view to bringing the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Article 9 1. The Advisory Committee may be consulted by a Member State or the Commission whenever a Member State or the Commission has doubts as to whether a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications included on one of the lists published in the Official Journal of the European Communities still meets the requirements of Articles 3 and 4. The Committee shall deliver its opinion within three months. 2. The Commission shall withdraw a diploma from one of the lists published in the Official Journal of the European Communities either in agreement with the Member State concerned or following a ruling by the Court of Justice. CHAPTER III DIPLOMAS, CERTIFICATES AND OTHER EVIDENCE OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS ENABLING THE HOLDER TO TAKE UP ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD OF ARCHITECTURE BY VIRTUE OF ESTABLISHED RIGHTS OR EXISTING NATIONAL PROVISIONS Article 10 Each Member State shall recognize the diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications set out in Article 11, awarded by other Member States to nationals of the Member States, where such nationals already possess these qualifications at the time of notification of this Directive or their studies leading to such diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications commences during the third academic year at the latest following such notification, even if those qualifications do not fulfil the minimum requirements laid down in Chapter II, by giving them as regards the taking up and pursuit of the activities referred to in Article 1 and subject to compliance with Article 23, the same effect within its territory as the diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications which it awards in architecture.

In the cases referred to in Article 17 (4) and Article 18 (2), a request for re-examination shall suspend the period laid down in paragraph 1. The Member State consulted shall give its reply within a period of three months. On receipt of the reply or at the end of the period the host Member State shall continue with the procedure referred to in paragraph 1. Article 21 Where a host Member State requires its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue the activities referred to in Article 1 to take an oath or make a solemn declaration and where the form of such oath or declaration cannot be used by nationals of other Member States, that Member State shall ensure that an appropriate and equivalent form of oath or declaration is offered to the person concerned. B. Provisions specific to the provision of services Article 22 1. Where a Member State requires of its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue the activities referred to in Article 1 either an authorization from or membership of or registration with a professional organization or body, that Member State shall, in the case of provision of services, exempt nationals of other Member States from that requirement.

For this purpose and in addition to the declaration referred to in paragraph 2 relating to the provision of services, Member States may, so as to permit the implementation of the provisions relating to professional conduct in force in their territory, require automatic temporary registration or pro forma registration with a professional organization or body or in a register, provided that this registration does not delay or in any way complicate the provision of services or impose any additional costs on the person providing the services. Where a host Member State adopts a measure pursuant to the second subparagraph or becomes aware of facts which run counter to these provisions, it shall forthwith inform the Member State in which the person concerned is established. 2. The host Member State may require the person concerned to make a prior declaration to the competent authorities about the services to be provided where they involve the execution of a project in its territory. 3.

Article 13 This Directive shall not affect any rights which an injured person may have according to the rules of the law of contractual or non-contractual liability or a special liability system existing at the moment when this Directive is notified.

"23","31984L0450","Article 1 The purpose of this Directive is to protect consumers, persons carrying on a trade or business or practising a craft or profession and the interests of the public in general against misleading advertising and the unfair consequences thereof. Article 2 For the purposes of this Directive: 1. 'advertising' means the making of a representation in any form in connection with a trade, business, craft or profession in order to promote the supply of goods or services, including immovable property, rights and obligations; 2. 'misleading advertising' means any advertising which in any way, including its presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the persons to whom it is addressed or whom it reaches and which, by reason of its deceptive nature, is likely to affect their economic behaviour or which, for those reasons, injures or is likely to injure a competitor; 3. 'person' means any natural or legal person. Article 3 In determining whether advertising is misleading, account shall be taken of all its features, and in particular of any information it contains concerning: (a) the characteristics of goods or services, such as their availability, nature, execution, composition, method and date of manufacture or provision, fitness for purpose, uses, quantity, specification, geographical or commercial origin or the results to be expected from their use, or the results and material features of tests or checks carried out on the goods or services; (b) the price or the manner in which the price is calculated, and the conditions on which the goods are supplied or the services provided; (c) the nature, attributes and rights of the advertiser, such as his identity and assets, his qualifications and ownership of industrial, commercial or intellectual property rights or his awards and distinctions. Article 4 1. Member States shall ensure that adequate and effective means exist for the control of misleading advertising in the interests of consumers as well as competitors and the general public. Such means shall include legal provisions under which persons or organizations regarded under national law as having a legitimate interest in prohibiting misleading advertising may: (a) take legal action against such advertising; and/or (b) bring such advertising before an administrative authority competent either to decide on complaints or to initiate appropriate legal proceedings. It shall be for each Member State to decide which of these facilities shall be available and whether to enable the courts or administrative authorities to require prior recourse to other established means of dealing with complaints, including those referred to in Article 5. 2. Under the legal provisions referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall confer upon the courts or administrative authorities powers enabling them, in cases where they deem such measures to be necessary taking into account all the interests involved and in particular the public interest: - to order the cessation of, or to institute appropriate legal proceedings for an order for the cessation of, misleading advertising, or - if misleading advertising has not yet been published but publication is imminent, to order the prohibition of, or to institute appropriate legal proceedings for an order for the prohibition of, such publication, even without proof of actual loss or damage or of intention or negligence on the part of the advertiser. Member States shall also make provision for the measures referred to in the first subparagraph to be taken under an accelerated procedure: - either with interim effect, or - with definitive effect, on the understanding that it is for each Member State to decide which of the two options to select. Furthermore, Member States may confer upon the courts or administrative authorities powers enabling them, with a view to eliminating the continuing effects of misleading advertising the cessation of which has been ordered by a final decision: - to require publication of that decision in full or in part and in such form as they deem adequate, - to require in addition the publication of a corrective statement. 3. The administrative authorities referred to in paragraph 1 must: (a) be composed so as not to cast doubt on their impartiality; (b) have adequate powers, where they decide on complaints, to monitor and enforce the observance of their decisions effectively; (c) normally give reasons for their decisions. Where the powers referred to in paragraph 2 are exercised exclusively by an administrative authority, reasons for its decisions shall always be given. Furthermore in this case, provision must be made for procedures whereby improper or unreasonable exercise of its powers by the administrative authority or improper or unreasonable failure to exercise the said powers can be the subject of judicial review. Article 5 This Directive does not exclude the voluntary control of misleading advertising by self-regulatory bodies and recourse to such bodies by the persons or organizations referred to in Article 4 if proceedings before such bodies are in addition to the court or administrative proceedings referred to in that Article. Article 6 Member States shall confer upon the courts or administrative authorities powers enabling them in the civil or administrative proceedings provided for in Article 4: (a) to require the advertiser to furnish evidence as to the accuracy of factual claims in advertising if, taking into account the legitimate interests of the advertiser and any other party to the proceedings, such a requirement appears appropriate on the basis of the circumstances of the particular case; and (b) to consider factual claims as inaccurate if the evidence demanded in accordance with (a) is not furnished or is deemed insufficient by the court or administrative authority. Article 7 This Directive shall not preclude Member States from retaining or adopting provisions with a view to ensuring more extensive protection for consumers, persons carrying on a trade, business, craft or profession, and the general public. Article 8 Member States shall bring into force the measures necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 October 1986 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.

Articles 3, 4 (2), 5, 6, 13 to 28, 29 (1), (3), (4) and (5), 30 to 38 and 39 (2) shall apply to the consolidated accounts and the consolidated annual report covered by this Article, references to parent undertakings being understood to refer to all the undertakings specified in paragraph 1 above. Without prejudice to Article 19 (2), however, the items ""capital"", ""share premium account"", ""revaluation reserve"", ""reserves"", ""profit or loss brought forward"", and ""profit or loss for the financial year"" to be included in the consolidated accounts shall be the aggregate amounts attributable to each of the undertakings specified in paragraph 1.Article 131. An undertaking need not be included in consolidated accounts where it is not material for the purposes of Article 16 (3).2. Where two or more undertakings satisfy the requirements of paragraph 1 above, they must nevertheless be included in consolidated accounts if, as a whole, they are material for the purposes of Article 16 (3).3. In addition, an undertaking need not be included in consolidated accounts where:(a) severe long-term restrictions substantially hinder:(aa) the parent undertaking in the exercise of its rights over the assets or management of that undertaking; or(bb) the exercise of unified management of that undertaking where it is in one of the relationships defined in Article 12 (1); or(b) the information necessary for the preparation of consolidated accounts in accordance with this Directive cannot be obtained without disproportionate expense or undue delay; or(c) the shares of that undertaking are held exclusively with a view to their subsequent resale.Article 141. Where the activities of one or more undertakings to be consolidated are so different that their inclusion in the consolidated accounts would be incompatible with the obligation imposed in Article 16 (3), such undertakings must, without prejudice to Article 33 of this Directive, be excluded from the consolidation.2. Paragraph 1 above shall not be applicable merely by virtue of the fact that the undertakings to be consolidated are partly industrial, partly commercial, and partly provide services, or because such undertakings carry on industrial or commercial activities involving different products or provide different services.3. Any application of paragraph 1 above and the reasons therefor must be disclosed in the notes on the accounts. Where the annual or consolidated accounts of the undertakings thus excluded from the consolidation are not published in the same Member State in accordance with Directive 68/151/EEC [6], they must be attached to the consolidated accounts or made available to the public. In the latter case it must be possible to obtain a copy of such documents upon request. The price of such a copy must not exceed its administrative cost.Article 151. A Member State may, for the purposes of Article 16 (3), permit the omission from consolidated accounts of any parent undertaking not carrying on any industrial or commercial activity which holds shares in a subsidiary undertaking on the basis of a joint arrangement with one or more undertakings not included in the consolidated accounts.2. The annual accounts of the parent undertaking shall be attached to the consolidated accounts.3. Where use is made of this derogation, either Article 59 of Directive 78/660/EEC shall apply to the parent undertaking's annual accounts or the information which would have resulted from its application must be given in the notes on those accounts.SECTION 2The preparation of consolidated accountsArticle 161. Consolidated accounts shall comprise the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated profit-and-loss account and the notes on the accounts. These documents shall constitute a composite whole.2. Consolidated accounts shall be drawn up clearly and in accordance with this Directive.3. Consolidated accounts shall give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the undertakings included therein taken as a whole.4. Where the application of the provisions of this Directive would not be sufficient to give a true and fair view within the meaning of paragraph 3 above, additional information must be given.5. Where, in exceptional cases, the application of a provision of Articles 17 to 35 and 39 is incompatible with the obligation imposed in paragraph 3 above, that provision must be departed from in order to give a true and fair view within the meaning of paragraph 3. Any such departure must be disclosed in the notes on the accounts together with an explanation of the reasons for it and a statement of its effect on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. The Member States may define the exceptional cases in question and lay down the relevant special rules.6. A Member State may require or permit the disclosure in the consolidated accounts of other information as well as that which must be disclosed in accordance with this Directive.Article 171. Articles 3 to 10, 13 to 26 and 28 to 30 of Directive 78/660/EEC shall apply in respect of the layout of consolidated accounts, without prejudice to the provisions of this Directive and taking account of the essential adjustments resulting from the particular characteristics of consolidated accounts as compared with annual accounts.2. Where there are special circumstances which would entail undue expense a Member State may permit stocks to be combined in the consolidated accounts.Article 18The assets and liabilities of undertakings included in a consolidation shall be incorporated in full in the consolidated balance sheet.Article 191. The book values of shares in the capital of undertakings included in a consolidation shall be set off against the proportion which they represent of the capital and reserves of those undertakings:(a) That set-off shall be effected on the basis of book values as at the date as at which such undertakings are included in the consolidations for the first time. Differences arising from such set-offs shall as far as possible be entered directly against those items in the consolidated balance sheet which have values above or below their book values.(b) A Member State may require or permit set-offs on the basis of the values of identifiable assets and liabilities as at the date of acquisition of the shares or, in the event of acquisition in two or more stages, as at the date on which the undertaking became a subsidiary.(c) Any difference remaining after the application of (a) or resulting from the application of (b) shall be shown as a separate item in the consolidated balance sheet with an appropriate heading. That item, the methods used and any significant changes in relation to the preceding financial year must be explained in the notes on the accounts. Where the offsetting of positive and negative differences is authorized by a Member State, a breakdown of such differences must also be given in the notes on the accounts.2. However, paragraph 1 above shall not apply to shares in the capital of the parent undertaking held either by that undertaking itself or by another undertaking included in the consolidation. In the consolidated accounts such shares shall be treated as own shares in accordance with Directive 78/660/EEC.Article 201. A Member State may require or permit the book values of shares held in the capital of an undertaking included in the consolidation to be set off against the corresponding percentage of capital only, provided that:(a) the shares held represent at least 90 % of the nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, of the accounting par value of the shares of that undertaking other than shares of the kind described in Article 29 (2) (a) of Directive 77/91/EEC [7];(b) the proportion referred to in (a) above has been attained pursuant to an arrangement providing for the issue of shares by an undertaking included in the consolidation; and(c) the arrangement referred to in (b) above did not include a cash payment exceeding 10 % of the nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, of the accounting par value of the shares issued.2. Any difference arising under paragraph 1 above shall be added to or deducted from consolidated reserves as appropriate.3. The application of the method described in paragraph 1 above, the resulting movement in reserves and the names and registered offices of the undertakings concerned shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts.Article 21The amount attributable to shares in subsidiary undertakings included in the consolidation held by persons other than the undertakings included in the consolidation shall be shown in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate item with an appropriate heading.Article 22The income and expenditure of undertakings included in a consolidation shall be incorporated in full in the consolidated profit-and-loss account.Article 23The amount of any profit or loss attributable to shares in subsidiary undertakings included in the consolidation held by persons other than the undertakings included in the consolidation shall be shown in the consolidated profit-and-loss account as a separate item with an appropriate heading.Article 24Consolidated accounts shall be drawn up in accordance with the principles enunciated in Articles 25 to 28.Article 251. The methods of consolidation must be applied consistently from one financial year to another.2. Derogations from the provisions of paragraph 1 above shall be permitted in exceptional cases. Any such derogations must be disclosed in the notes on the accounts and the reasons for them given together with an assessment of their effect on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole.Article 261. Consolidated accounts shall show the assets, liabilities, financial positions and profits or losses of the undertakings included in a consolidation as if the latter were a single undertaking. In particular:(a) debts and claims between the undertakings included in a consolidation shall be eliminated from the consolidated accounts;(b) income and expenditure relating to transactions between the undertakings included in a consolidation shall be eliminated from the consolidated accounts;(c) where profits and losses resulting from transactions between the undertakings included in a consolidation are included in the book values of assets, they shall be eliminated from the consolidated accounts. Pending subsequent coordination, however, a Member State may allow the eliminations mentioned above to be effected in proportion to the percentage of the capital held by the parent undertaking in each of the subsidiary undertakings included in the consolidation.2. A Member State may permit derogations from the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) above where a transaction has been concluded according to normal market conditions and where the elimination of the profit or loss would entail undue expense. Any such derogations must be disclosed and where the effect on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the undertakings, included in the consolidation, taken as a whole, is material, that fact must be disclosed in the notes on the consolidated accounts.3. Derogations from the provisions of paragraph 1 (a), (b) or (c) above shall be permitted where the amounts concerned are not material for the purposes of Article 16 (3).Article 271. Consolidated accounts must be drawn up as at the same date as the annual accounts of the parent undertaking.2. A Member State may, however, require or permit consolidated accounts to be drawn up as at another date in order to take account of the balance sheet dates of the largest number or the most important of the undertakings included in the consolidation. Where use is made of this derogation that fact shall be disclosed in the notes on the consolidated accounts together with the reasons therefor. In addition, account must be taken or disclosure made of important events concerning the assets and liabilities, the financial position or the profit or loss of an undertaking included in a consolidation which have occurred between that undertaking's balance sheet date and the consolidated balance sheet date.3. Where an undertaking's balance sheet date precedes the consolidated balance sheet date by more than three months, that undertaking shall be consolidated on the basis of interim accounts drawn up as at the consolidated balance sheet date.Article 28If the composition of the undertakings included in a consolidation has changed significantly in the course of a financial year, the consolidated accounts must include information which makes the comparison of successive sets of consolidated accounts meaningful. Where such a change is a major one, a Member State may require or permit this obligation to be fulfilled by the preparation of an adjusted opening balance sheet and an adjusted profit-and-loss account.Article 291. Assets and liabilities to be included in consolidated accounts shall be valued according to uniform methods and in accordance with Articles 31 to 42 and 60 of Directive 78/660/EEC.2. (a) An undertaking which draws up consolidated accounts must apply the same methods of valuation as in its annual accounts. However, a Member State may require or permit the use in consolidated accounts of other methods of valuation in accordance with the abovementioned Articles of Directive 78/660/EEC.(b) Where use is made of this derogation that fact shall be disclosed in the notes on the consolidated accounts and the reasons therefor given.3. Where assets and liabilities to be included in consolidated accounts have been valued by undertakings included in the consolidation by methods differing from those used for the consolidation, they must be revalued in accordance with the methods used for the consolidation, unless the results of such revaluation are not material for the purposes of Article 16 (3). Departures from this principle shall be permitted in exceptional cases. Any such departures shall be disclosed in the notes on the consolidated accounts and the reasons for them given.4. Account shall be taken in the consolidated balance sheet and in the consolidated profit-and-loss account of any difference arising on consolidation between the tax chargeable for the financial year and for preceding financial years and the amount of tax paid or payable in respect of those years, provided that it is probable that an actual charge to tax will arise within the foreseeable future for one of the undertakings included in the consolidation.5. Where assets to be included in consolidated accounts have been the subject of exceptional value adjustments solely for tax purposes, they shall be incorporated in the consolidated accounts only after those adjustments have been eliminated. A Member State may, however, require or permit that such assets be incorporated in the consolidated accounts without the elimination of the adjustments, provided that their amounts, together with the reasons for them, are disclosed in the notes on the consolidated accounts.Article 301. A separate item as defined in Article 19 (1) (c) which corresponds to a positive consolidation difference shall be dealt with in accordance with the rules laid down in Directive 78/660/EEC for the item ""goodwill"".2. A Member State may permit a positive consolidation difference to be immediately and clearly deducted from reserves.Article 31An amount shown as a separate item, as defined in Article 19 (1) (c), which corresponds to a negative consolidation difference may be transferred to the consolidated profit-and-loss account only:(a) where that difference corresponds to the expectation at the date of acquisition of unfavourable future results in that undertaking, or to the expectation of costs which that undertaking would incur, in so far as such an expectation materializes; or(b) in so far as such a difference corresponds to a realized gain.Article 321. Where an undertaking included in a consolidation manages another undertaking jointly with one or more undertakings not included in that consolidation, a Member State may require or permit the inclusion of that other undertaking in the consolidated accounts in proportion to the rights in its capital held by the undertaking included in the consolidation.2. Articles 13 to 31 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the proportional consolidation referred to in paragraph 1 above.3. Where this Article is applied, Article 33 shall not apply if the undertaking proportionally consolidated is an associated undertaking as defined in Article 33.Article 331. Where an undertaking included in a consolidation exercises a significant influence over the operating and financial policy of an undertaking not included in the consolidation (an associated undertaking) in which it holds a participating interest, as defined in Article 17 of Directive 78/660/EEC, that participating interest shall be shown in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate item with an appropriate heading. An undertaking shall be presumed to exercise a significant influence over another undertaking where it has 20 % or more of the shareholders' or members' voting rights in that undertaking. Article 2 shall apply.2. When this Article is applied for the first time to a participating interest covered by paragraph 1 above, that participating interest shall be shown in the consolidated balance sheet either:(a) at its book value calculated in accordance with the valuation rules laid down in Directive 78/660/EEC. The difference between that value and the amount corresponding to the proportion of capital and reserves represented by that participating interest shall be disclosed separately in the consolidated balance sheet or in the notes on the accounts. That difference shall be calculated as at the date as at which that method is used for the first time; or(b) at an amount corresponding to the proportion of the associated undertaking's capital and reserves represented by that participating interest. The difference between that amount and the book value calculated in accordance with the valuation rules laid down in Directive 78/660/EEC shall be disclosed separately in the consolidated balance sheet or in the notes on the accounts. That difference shall be calculated as at the date as at which that method is used for the first time.(c) A Member State may prescribe the application of one or other of (a) and (b) above. The consolidated balance sheet or the notes on the accounts must indicate whether (a) or (b) has been used.(d) In addition, for the purposes of (a) and (b) above, a Member State may require or permit the calculation of the difference as at the date of acquisition of the shares or, where they were acquired in two or more stages, as at the date on which the undertaking became an associated undertaking.3. Where an associated undertaking's assets or liabilities have been valued by methods other than those used for consolidation in accordance with Article 29 (2), they may, for the purpose of calculating the difference referred to in paragraph 2 (a) or (b) above, be revalued by the methods used for consolidation. Where such revaluation has not been carried out that fact must be disclosed in the notes on the accounts. A Member State may require such revaluation.4. The book value referred to in paragraph 2 (a) above, or the amount corresponding to the proportion of the associated undertaking's capital and reserves referred to in paragraph 2 (b) above, shall be increased or reduced by the amount of any variation which has taken place during the financial year in the proportion of the associated undertaking's capital and reserves represented by that participating interest; it shall be reduced by the amount of the dividends relating to that participating interest.5. In so far as the positive difference referred to in paragraph 2 (a) or (b) above cannot be related to any category of assets or liabilities it shall be dealt with in accordance with Articles 30 and 39 (3).6. The proportion of the profit or loss of the associated undertakings attributable to such participating interests shall be shown in the consolidated profit-and-loss account as a separate item under an appropriate heading.7. The eliminations referred to in Article 26 (1) (c) shall be effected in so far as the facts are known or can be ascertained. Article 26 (2) and (3) shall apply.8. Where an associated undertaking draws up consolidated accounts, the foregoing provisions shall apply to the capital and reserves shown in such consolidated accounts.9. This Article need not be applied where the participating interest in the capital of the associated undertaking is not material for the purposes of Article 16 (3).Article 34In addition to the information required under other provisions of this Directive, the notes on the accounts must set out information in respect of the following matters at least:1. The valuation methods applied to the various items in the consolidated accounts, and the methods employed in calculating the value adjustments. For items included in the consolidated accounts which are or were originally expressed in foreign currency the bases of conversion used to express them in the currency in which the consolidated accounts are drawn up must be disclosed.2. (a) The names and registered offices of the undertakings included in the consolidation; the proportion of the capital held in undertakings included in the consolidation, other than the parent undertaking, by the undertakings included in the consolidation or by persons acting in their own names but on behalf of those undertakings; which of the conditions referred to in Articles 1 and 12 (1) following application of Article 2 has formed the basis on which the consolidation has been carried out. The latter disclosure may, however, be omitted where consolidation has been carried out on the basis of Article 1 (1) (a) and where the proportion of the capital and the proportion of the voting rights held are the same.(b) The same information must be given in respect of undertakings exluded from a consolidation pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 and, without prejudice to Article 14 (3), an explanation must be given for the exclusion of the undertakings referred to in Article 13.3. (a) The names and registered offices of undertakings associated with an undertaking included in the consolidation as described in Article 33 (1) and the proportion of their capital held by undertakings included in the consolidation or by persons acting in their own names but on behalf of those undertakings.(b) The same information must be given in respect of the associated undertakings referred to in Article 33 (9), together with the reasons for applying that provision.4.

This information may be omitted where, for the purposes of Article 16 (3), it is of negligible importance only. The information concerning capital and reserves and the profit or loss may also be omitted where the undertaking concerned does not publish its balance sheet and where less than 50 % of its capital is held (directly or indirectly) by the abovementioned undertakings.6.

The consolidated net turnover as defined in Article 28 of Directive 78/660/EEC, broken down by categories of activity and into geographical markets in so far as, taking account of the manner in which the sale of products and the provision of services falling within the ordinary activities of the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole are organized, these categories and markets differ substantially from one another.9. (a) The average number of persons employed during the financial year by undertakings included in the consolidation broken down by categories and, if they are not disclosed separately in the consolidated profit-and-loss account, the staff costs relating to the financial year.(b) The average number of persons employed during the financial year by undertakings to which Article 32 has been applied shall be disclosed separately.10.

The difference between the tax charged to the consolidated profit-and-loss account for the financial year and to those for earlier financial years and the amount of tax payable in respect of those years, provided that this difference is material for the purposes of future taxation.

When, for the first time, consolidated accounts are drawn up in accordance with this Directive for a body of undertakings which was already connected, as described in Article 1 (1), before application of the provisions referred to in Article 49 (1), a Member State may require or permit that, for the purposes of Article 19 (1), account be taken of the book value of a holding and the proportion of the capital and reserves that it represents as at a date before or the same as that of the first consolidation.2. Paragraph 1 above shall apply mutatis mutandis to the valuation for the purposes of Article 33 (2) of a holding, or of the proportion of capital and reserves that it represents, in the capital of an undertaking associated with an undertaking included in the consolidation, and to the proportional consolidation referred to in Article 32.3.

Until expiry of the deadline imposed for the application in national law of the Directives supplementing Directive 78/660/EEC as regards the harmonization of the rules governing the annual accounts of banks and other financial institutions and insurance undertakings, a Member State may derogate from the provisions of this Directive concerning the layout of consolidated accounts, the methods of valuing the items included in those accounts and the information to be given in the notes on the accounts:(a) with regard to any undertaking to be consolidated which is a bank, another financial institution or an insurance undertaking;(b) where the undertakings to be consolidated comprise principally banks, financial institutions or insurance undertakings.They may also derogate from Article 6, but only in so far as the limits and criteria to be applied to the above undertakings are concerned.2. In so far as a Member State has not required all undertakings which are banks, other financial institutions or insurance undertakings to draw up consolidated accounts before implementation of the provisions referred to in Article 49 (1), it may, until its national law implements one of the Directives mentioned in paragraph 1 above, but not in respect of financial years ending after 1993:(a) suspend the application of the obligation imposed in Article 1 (1) with respect to any of the above undertakings which is a parent undertaking.

Where a Member State prescribes the preparation of consolidated accounts pursuant to Article 1 (1) (c), (d) (aa) or (2) or Article 12 (1), the undertakings which are connected as described in those Articles and those other undertakings which are connected similarly, or are connected as described in paragraph 1 above to one of the aforementioned undertakings, shall be affiliated undertakings as defined in paragraph 1.3. Even where a Member State does not prescribe the preparation of consolidated accounts pursuant to Article 1 (1) (c), (d) (aa) or (2) or Article 12 (1), it may apply paragraph 2 of this Article.4. Articles 2 and 3 (2) shall apply.5.

Article 1 (2) and (3) of Directive 78/855/EEC shall apply. CHAPTER I Division by acquisition Article 2 1. For the purposes of this Directive, division by acquisition shall mean the operation whereby, after being wound up without going into liquidation, a company transfers to more than one company all its assets and liabilities in exchange for the allocation to the shareholders of the company being divided of shares in the companies receiving contributions as a result of the division (hereinafter referred to as recipient companies) and possibly a cash payment not exceeding 10 % of the nominal value of the shares allocated or, where they have no nominal value, of their accounting par value. 2.

(b) Where a liability is not allocated by the draft terms of division and where the interpretation of these terms does not make a decision on its allocation possible, each of the recipient companies shall be jointly and severally liable for it. Member States may provide that such joint and several liability be limited to the net assets allocated to each company. Article 4 Draft terms of division must be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/15I/EEC (10) for each of the companies involved in a division, at least one month before the date of the general meeting which is to decide thereon.

It shall disclose the preparation of the report on the consideration other than in cash referred to in Article 27 (2) of Directive 77/91/EEC (11) for recipient companies and the register where that report must be lodged. 3.

Article 8 1. One or more experts acting on behalf of each of the companies involved in the division but independent of them, appointed or approved by a judicial or administrative authority, shall examine the draft terms of division and draw up a written report to the shareholders. However, the laws of a Member State may provide for the appointment of one or more independent experts for all of the companies involved in a division if such appointment is made by a judicial or administrative authority at the joint request of those companies. Such experts may, depending on the laws of each Member State, be natural or legal persons or companies or firms. 2. Article 10 (2) and (3) of Directive 78/855/EEC shall apply. 3.

Article 11 Protection of the rights of the employees of each of the companies involved in a division shall be regulated in accordance with Directive 77/187/EEC (12). Article 12 1. The laws of Member States must provide for an adequate system of protection for the interests of the creditors of the companies involved in a division whose claims antedate publication of the draft terms of division and have not yet fallen due at the time of such publication. 2. To that end, the laws of Member States shall at least provide that such creditors shall be entitled to obtain adequate safeguards where the financial situation of the company being divided and that of the company to which the obligation will be transferred in accordance with the draft terms of division make such protection necessary and where those creditors do not already have such safeguards. 3. In so far as a creditor of the company to which the obligation has been transferred in accordance with the draft terms of division has not obtained satisfaction, the recipient companies shall be jointly and severally liable for that obligation. Member States may limit that liability to the net assets allocated to each of those companies other than the one to which the obligation has been transferred. However, they need not apply this paragraph where the division operation is subject to the supervision of a judicial authority in accordance with Article 23 and a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or any class of creditors of the company being divided have agreed to forego such joint and several liability at a meeting held pursuant to Article 23 (l) (c). 4. Article 13 (3) of Directive 78/855/EEC shall apply. 5. Without prejudice to the rules governing the collective exercise of their rights, paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply to the debenture holders of the companies involved in the division except where the division has been approved by a meeting of the debenture holders, if such a meeting is provided for under national laws, or by the debenture holders individually. 6. Member States may provide that the recipient companies shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the company being divided. In such case they need not apply the foregoing paragraphs. 7. Where a Member State combines the system of creditor protection set out in paragraph 1 to 5 with the joint and several liability of the recipient companies as referred to in paragraph 6, it may limit such joint and several liability to the net assets allocated to each of those companies. Article 13 Holders of securities, other than shares, to which special rights are attached, must be given rights in the recipient companies against which such securities may be invoked in accordance with the draft terms of division, at least equivalent to the rights they possessed in the company being divided, unless the alteration of those rights has been approved by a meeting of the holders of such securities, if such a meeting is provided for under national laws, or by the holders of those securities individually, or unless the holders are entitled to have their securities repurchased. Article 14 Where the laws of a Member State do not provide for judicial or administrative preventive supervision of the legality of divisions or where such supervision does not extend to all the legal acts required for a division, Article 16 of Directive 78/855/EEC shall apply. Article 15 The laws of Member States shall determine the date on which a division takes effect. Article 16 1. A division must be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC in respect of each of the companies involved in a division. 2. Any recipient company may itself carry out the publication formalities relating to the company being divided. Article 17 1. A division shall have the following consequences ipso jure and simultaneously: (a) the transfer, both as between the company being divided and the recipient companies and as regards third parties, to each of the recipient companies of all the assets and liabilities of the company being divided; such transfer shall take effect with the assets and liabilities being divided in accordance with the allocation laid down in the draft terms of division or in Article 3 (3); (b) the shareholders of the company being divided become shareholders of one or more of the recipient companies in accordance with the allocation laid down in the draft terms of division; (c) the company being divided ceases to exist. 2. No shares in a recipient company shall be exchanged for shares held in the company being divided either: (a) by that recipient company itself or by a person acting in his own name but on its behalf; or (b) by the company being divided itself or by a person acting in his own name but on its behalf. 3. The foregoing shall not affect the laws of Member States which require the completion of special formalities for the transfer of certain assets, rights and obligations by a company being divided to be effective as against third parties. The recipient company or companies to which such assets, rights or obligations are transferred in accordance with the draft terms of division or with Article 3 (3) may carry out these formalities themselves; however, the laws of Member States may permit a company being divided to continue to carry out these formalities for a limited period which may not, save in exceptional circumstances, be fixed at more than six months from the date on which the division takes effect. Article 18 The laws of Member States shall at least lay down rules governing the civil liability of members of the administrative or management bodies of a company being divided towards the shareholders of that company in respect of misconduct on the part of members of those bodies in preparing and implementing the division and the civil liability of the experts responsible for drawing up for that company the report provided for in Article 8 in respect of misconduct on the part of those experts in the performance of their duties. Article 19 1. The laws of Member States may lay down nullity rules for divisions in accordance with the following conditions only: (a) nullity must be ordered in a court judgment; (b) divisions which have taken effect pursuant to Article 15 may be declared void only if there has been no judicial or administrative preventive supervision of their legality, or if they have not been drawn up and certified in due legal form, or if it is shown that the decision of the general meeting is void or voidable under national law; (c) nullification proceedings may not be initiated more than six months after the date on which the division becomes effective as against the person alleging nullity or if the situation has been rectified; (d) where it is possible to remedy a defect liable to render a division void, the competent court shall grant the companies involved a period of time within which to rectify the situation; (e) a judgment declaring a division void shall be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151 /EEC; (f) where the laws of a Member State permit a third party to challenge such a judgment, he may do so only within six months of publication of the judgment in the manner prescribed by Directive 68/151/EEC; (g) a judgment declaring a division void shall not of itself affect the validity of obligations owed by or in relation to the recipient companies which arose before the judgment was published and after the date referred to in Article 15; (h) each of the recipient companies shall be liable for its obligations arising after the date on which the division took effect and before the date on which the decision pronouncing the nullity of the division was published. The company being divided shall also be liable for such obligations; Member States may provide that this liability be limited to the share of net assets transferred to the recipient company on whose account such obligations arose. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 (a), the laws of a Member State may also provide for the nullity of a division to be ordered by an administrative authority if an appeal against such a decision lies to a court. Subparagraphs (b), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) shall apply by analogy to the administrative authority. Such nullification proceedings may not be initiated more than six months after the date referred to in Article 15. 3. The foregoing shall not affect the laws of the Member States on the nullity of a division pronounced following any supervision of legality. Article 20 Without prejudice to Article 6, Member States need not require the division to be approved by the general meeting of the company being divided where the recipient companies together hold all the shares of the company being divided and all other securities conferring the right to vote at general meetings of the company being divided, and the following conditions, at least, are fulfilled: (a) each of the companies involved in the operation must carry out the publication provided for in Article 4 at least one month before the operation takes effect; (b) at least one month before the operation takes effect, all shareholders of companies involved in the operation must be entitled to inspect the documents specified in Article 9 (1), at their company's registered office. Article 9 (2) and (3) shall also apply; (c) one or more shareholders of the company being divided holding a minimum percentage of the subscribed capital must be entitled to require that a general meeting of the company being divided be called to decide whether to approve the division. This minimum percentage may not be fixed at more than 5 %. Member States may, however, provide for the exclusion of non-voting shares from this calculation; (d) where a general meeting of the company being divided, required for the approval of the division, is not summoned, the information provided for by Article 7 (3) covers any material change in the asset and liabilities after the date of preparation of the draft terms of division. CHAPTER II Division by the formation of new companies Article 21 1. For the purposes of this Directive, division by the formation of new companies means the operation whereby, after being wound up without going into liquidation, a company transfers to more than one newly-formed company all its assets and liabilities in exchange for the allocation to the shareholders of the company being divided of shares in the recipient companies, and possibly a cash payment not exceeding 10 % of the nominal value of the shares allocated or, where they have no nominal value, of their accounting par value. 2. Article 4 (2) of Directive 78/855/EEC shall apply. Article 22 1. Articles 3, 4, 5 and 7, 8 (1) and (2) and 9 to 19 of this Directive shall apply, without prejudice to Articles 11 and 12 of Directive 68/151/EEC, to division by the formation of new companies. For this purpose, the expression companies involved in a division shall refer to the company being divided and the expression recipient companies shall refer to each of the new companies. 2. In addition to the information specified in Article 3 (2), the draft terms of division shall indicate the form, name and registered office of each of the new companies. 3. The draft terms of division and, if they are contained in a separate document, the memorandum or draft memorandum of association and the articles or draft articles of association of each of the new companies shall be approved at a general meeting of the company being divided. 4. Member States may provide that the report on the consideration other than in cash as referred to in Article 10 of Directive 77/91/EEC and the report on the draft terms of division as referred to in Article 8 (1) shall be drawn up by the same expert or experts. 5. Member States may provide that neither Article 8, nor Article 9 as regards the expert's report, shall apply where the shares in each of the new companies are allocated to the shareholders of the company being divided in proportion to their rights in the capital of that company. CHAPTER III Division under the supervision of a judicial authority Article 23 1. Member States may apply paragraph 2 where division operations are subject to the supervision of a judicial authority having the power: (a) to call a general meeting of the shareholders of the company being divided in order to decide upon the division; (b) to ensure that the shareholders of each of the companies involved in a division have received or can obtain at least the documents referred to in Article 9 in time to examine them before the date of the general meeting of their company called to decide upon the division. Where a Member State makes use of the option provided for in Article 6 the period must be long enough for the shareholders of the recipient companies to be able to exercise the rights conferred on them by that Article; (c) to call any meeting of creditors of each of the companies involved in a division in order to decide upon the division; (d) to ensure that the creditors of each of the companies involved in a division have received or can obtain at least the draft terms of division in time to examine them before the date referred to in (b); (e) to approve the draft terms of division. 2. Where the judicial authority establishes that the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 (b) and (d) have been fulfilled and that no prejudice would be caused to shareholders or creditors, it may relieve the companies involved in the division from applying: (a) Article 4, on condition that the adequate system of protection of the interest of the creditors referred to in Article 12 (1) covers all claims regardless of their date; (b) he conditions referred to in Article 6 (a) and (b) where a Member State makes use of the option provided for in Article 6; c) Article 9, as regards the period and the manner prescribed for the inspection of the documents referred to therein. CHAPTER IV Other operations treated as divisions Article 24 Where, in the case of one of the operations specified in Article 1, the laws of a Member State permit the cash payment to exceed 10 %, Chapters I, II and III shall apply. Article 25 Where the laws of a Member State permit one of the operations specified in Article 1 without the company being divided ceasing to exist, Chapters I, II and III shall apply, except for Article 17 (1) (c). CHAPTER V Final provisions Article 26 1. The Member States shall bring into force before 1 January 1986, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary for them to comply with this Directive provided that on that date they permit the operations to which this Directive applies. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof. 2. Where, after the date mentioned in paragraph 1, a Member State permits division operations, it shall bring into force the provisions mentioned in that paragraph on the date on which it permits such operations. It shall immediately inform the Commission thereof. 3. However, provision may be made for a period of five years from the entry into force of the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 for the application of those provisions to unregistered companies in the United Kingdom and Ireland. 4. Member States need not apply Articles 12 and 13 as regards the holders of convertible debentures and other securities convertible into shares if, at the time when the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 or 2 come into force, the position of these holders in the event of a division has previously been determined by the conditions of issue. 5. Member States need not apply this Directive to divisions or to operations treated as divisions for the preparation or execution of which an act or formality required by national law has already been completed when the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 or 2 enter into force.

Where in a Member State the taking up or pursuit of the activities referred to in Article 1 is subject to possession of general, commercial and professional knowledge and ability, that Member State shall accept as sufficient evidence of such knowledge and ability the fact that the activities in question have been pursued lawfully in another Member State for any of the following periods: (a) six consecutive years either in a self-employed capacity or as a person responsible for managing an undertaking; or (b) three consecutive years either in a self-employed capacity or as a person responsible for managing an undertaking, where the beneficiary can prove that for the occupation in question he has received at least three years' previous training, attested by a certificate recognized by the State, or regarded by a competent professional body as fully satisfying its requirements; or (c) three consecutive years in a self-employed capacity, where the beneficiary can prove that he has pursued the occupation in question for at least five years in the capacity of employee. The host Member State, in so far as it lays down different conditions of qualification for the activities of men's and women's hairdressing, may require of nationals of other Member States that the activity in question has been pursued and vocational training received, in the same branch as that in which the beneficiary wishes to establish himself in the host Member State. 2. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 (a) and (c), pursuit of the activity in question shall not have ceased more than 10 years before the date on which the application provided for in Article 3 is made. Activities in a self-employed capacity or as a person responsible for managing an undertaking as referred to in subparagraphs 1 (a) and (c) must have been pursued after the age of 20.

Where the country of origin or the country whence the foreign national comes does not issue the document referred to in paragraph 1, furnishing proof of good repute or proof of no previous bankruptcy, such proof may be replaced by a declaration on oath - or, in States where there is no provision for declaration on oath, by a solemn declaration - made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority, or where appropriate a notary, in the country of origin or the country whence that person comes; such authority or notary will issue a certificate attesting the authenticity of the declaration on oath or solemn declaration. The declaration in respect of no previous bankruptcy may also be made before a competent professional or trade body in the said country. 3. Where in the host Member State proof of financial standing is required, that State shall regard certificates issued by banks in other Member States as equivalent to certificates issued in its own territory. 4. Documents issued in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 may not be produced more than three months after their date of issue.

This Directive shall apply to employees' claims arising from contracts of employment or employment relationships and existing against employers who are in a state of insolvency within the meaning of Article 2 (1). 2. Member States may, by way of exception, exclude claims by certain categories of employee from the scope of this Directive, by virtue of the special nature of the employee's contract of employment or employment relationship or of the existence of other forms of guarantee offering the employee protection equivalent to that resulting from this Directive. The categories of employee referred to in the first subparagraph are listed in the Annex. 3. This Directive shall not apply to Greenland. This exception shall be re-examined in the event of any development in the job structures in that region. Article 2 1. For the purposes of this Directive, an employer shall be deemed to be in a state of insolvency: (a) where a request has been made for the opening of proceedings involving the employer's assets, as provided for under the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member State concerned, to satisfy collectively the claims of creditors and which make it possible to take into consideration the claims referred to in Article 1 (1), and (b) where the authority which is competent pursuant to the said laws, regulations and administrative provisions has: - either decided to open the proceedings, - or established that the employer's undertaking or business has been definitively closed down and that the available assets are insufficient to warrant the opening of the proceedings.

This Directive is without prejudice to national law as regards the definition of the terms ""employee"", ""employer"", ""pay"", ""right conferring immediate entitlement"" and ""right conferring prospective entitlement"". SECTION II Provisions concerning guarantee institutions Article 3 1. Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that guarantee institutions guarantee, subject to Article 4, payment of employees' outstanding claims resulting from contracts of employment or employment relationships and relating to pay for the period prior to a given date. 2. At the choice of the Member States, the date referred to in paragraph 1 shall be: - either that of the onset of the employer's insolvency; - or that of the notice of dismissal issued to the employee concerned on account of the employer's insolvency; - or that of the onset of the employer's insolvency or that on which the contract of employment or the employment relationship with the employee concerned was discontinued on account of the employer's insolvency. Article 4 1. Member States shall have the option to limit the liability of guarantee institutions, referred to in Article 3. 2. When Member States exercise the option referred to in paragraph 1, they shall: - in the case referred to in Article 3 (2), first indent, ensure the payment of outstanding claims relating to pay for the last three months of the contract of employment or employment relationship occurring within a period of six months preceding the date of the onset of the employer's insolvency; - in the case referred to in Article 3 (2), second indent, ensure the payment of outstanding claims relating to pay for the last three months of the contract of employment or employment relationship preceding the date of the notice of dismissal issued to the employee on account of the employer's insolvency; - in the case referred to in Article 3 (2), third indent, ensure the payment of outstanding claims relating to pay for the last 18 months of the contract of employment or employment relationship preceding the date of the onset of the employer's insolvency or the date on which the contract of employment or the employment relationship with the employee was discontinued on account of the employer's insolvency. In this case, Member States may limit the liability to make payment to pay corresponding to a period of eight weeks or to several shorter periods totalling eight weeks. 3. However, in order to avoid the payment of sums going beyond the social objective of this Directive, Member States may set a ceiling to the liability for employees' outstanding claims. When Member States exercise this option, they shall inform the Commission of the methods used to set the ceiling. Article 5 Member States shall lay down detailed rules for the organization, financing and operation of the guarantee institutions, complying with the following principles in particular: (a) the assets of the institutions shall be independent of the employers' operating capital and be inaccessible to proceedings for insolvency; (b) employers shall contribute to financing, unless it is fully covered by the public authorities; (c) the institutions' liabilities shall not depend on whether or not obligations to contribute to financing have been fulfilled. SECTION III Provisions concerning social security Article 6 Member States may stipulate that Articles 3, 4 and 5 shall not apply to contributions due under national statutory social security schemes or under supplementary company or inter-company pension schemes outside the national statutory social security schemes. Article 7 Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that non-payment of compulsory contributions due from the employer, before the onset of his insolvency, to their insurance institutions under national statutory social security schemes does not adversely affect employees' benefit entitlement in respect of these insurance institutions inasmuch as the employees' contributions were deducted at source from the remuneration paid. Article 8 Member States shall ensure that the necessary measures are taken to protect the interests of employees and of persons having already left the employer's undertaking or business at the date of the onset of the employer's insolvency in respect of rights conferring on them immediate or prospective entitlement to old-age benefits, including survivors' benefits, under supplementary company or inter-company pension schemes outside the national statutory social security schemes. SECTION IV General and final provisions Article 9 This Directive shall not affect the option of Member States to apply or introduce laws, regulations or administrative provisions which are more favourable to employees. Article 10 This Directive shall not affect the option of Member States: (a) to take the measures necessary to avoid abuses; (b) to refuse or reduce the liability referred to in Article 3 or the guarantee obligation referred to in Article 7 if it appears that fulfilment of the obligation is unjustifiable because of the existence of special links between the employee and the employer and of common interests resulting in collusion between them. Article 11 1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive within 36 months of its notification. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.

"30","31980L0778","Article 1 This Directive concerns standards for water intended for human consumption. Article 2 For the purposes of this Directive, water intended for human consumption shall mean all water used for that purpose, either in its original state or after treatment, regardless of origin, - whether supplied for consumption, or - whether - used in a food production undertaking for the manufacture, processing, preservation or marketing of products or substances intended for human consumption and - affecting the wholesomeness of the foodstuff in its finished form. Article 3 With regard to water referred to in the second indent of Article 2, Member States shall apply the values for the toxic and microbiological parameters lised in Tables D and E respectively of Annex I and the values for the other parameters which the competent national authorities consider are likely to affect the wholesomeness of the foodstuff in its finished form. Article 4 1. This Directive shall not apply to: (a) natural mineral waters recognized or defined as such by the competent national authorities; (b) medicinal waters recognized as such by the competent national authorities. 2. Member States may not prohibit or impede the marketing of foodstuffs on grounds relating to the quality of the water used where the quality of such water meets the requirements of this Directive unless such marketing constitutes a hazard to public health. Article 5 This Directive shall apply without prejudice to the specific provisions of other Community regulations. Article 6 1. Member States shall send the Commission: - appropriate information as to the industrial sectors in which the competent national authorities consider that the wholesomeness of the finished product, within the meaning of Article 2, is unaffected by the quality of the water used; - national values for parameters other than the toxic and microbiological parameters referred to in Article 3. 2. The Commission shall examine this information and shall take any measures which may be appropriate. It shall periodically draw up a comprehensive report for the Member States. Article 7 1. Member States shall fix values applicable to water intended for human consumption for the parameters shown in Annex I. 2. Member States may refrain from fixing, pursuant to the first paragraph, the values of parameters in respect of which no value is shown in Annex I, as long as these values have not been determined by the Council. 3. For the parameters given in Tables A, B, C, D, and E of Annex I: - the values to be fixed by the Member States must be less than or the same as the values shown in the ""Maximum admissible concentration"" column; - in fixing the values, Member States shall take as a basis the values appearing in the ""Guide level"" column. 4. For the parameters appearing in Table F of Annex I, the values to be fixed by Member States must be not lower than those given in the ""Minimum required concentration"" column for softened water, of the kind referred to in the first indent of Article 2. 5. In the interpretation of the values shown in Annex I account shall be taken of the observations. 6. Member States shall take the steps necessary to ensure that water intended for human consumption at least meets the requirements specified in Annex I. Article 8 Member States shall take all the necessary measures to ensure that any substances used in the preparation of water for human consumption do not remain in concentrations higher than the maximum admissible concentration relating to these substances in water made available to the user and, that they do not, either directly or indirectly, constitute a public health hazard. Article 9 1. Member States may make provision for derogations from this Directive in order to take account of: (a) situations arising from the nature and structure of the ground in the area from which the supply in question emanates. Where a Member State decides to make such a derogation, it shall inform the Commission accordingly within two months of its decision stating the reasons for such derogation; (b) situations arising from exceptional meteorological conditions. Where a Member State decides to make such a derogation, it shall inform the Commission accordingly within 15 days of its decision stating the reasons for this derogation and its duration. 2. Member States shall report to the Commission only those derogations referred to in paragraph 1 which relate to a daily water supply of at least 1 000 m3 or a population of at least 5 000. 3. In no case shall the derogations made by virtue of this Article relate to toxic or microbiological factors or constitute a public health hazard. Article 10 1. In the event of emergencies, the competent national authorities may, for a limited period of time and up to a maximum value to be determined by them, allow the maximum admissible concentration shown in Annex I to be exceeded, provided that this does not constitute an unacceptable risk to public health and provided that the supply of water for human consumption cannot be maintained in any other way. 2. Without prejudice to the application of Directive 75/440/EEC, and in particular Article 4 (3) thereof, when, for its supply of drinking water, a Member State is obliged to resort to surface water which does not reach the concentrations required of category A3 water within the meaning of Article 2 of the aformentioned Directive and when it cannot devise suitable treatment to obtain drinking water of the quality laid down by this Directive, it may, for a limited period of time and up to a maximum permissible value which it shall determine, authorize the maximum admissible concentration shown in Annex I to be exceeded provided that this does not constitute an unacceptable risk to public health. 3. Member States which have recourse to the derogations referred to in this Article shall immediately inform the Commission thereof, stating the reasons for and probable duration of such derogations. Article 11 Member States shall ensure that all necessary measures taken to apply the provisions taken pursuant to this Directive shall in no case have the effect of allowing, directly or indirectly, either any deterioration in the present quality of water intended for human consumption or an increase in the pollution of waters used for the production of drinking water. Article 12 1. Member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure regular monitoring of the quality of water intended for human consumption. 2. All water intended for human consumption shall be monitored at the point where it is made available to the user in order to check whether it meets the requirements laid down in Annex I. 3. The points of sampling shall be determined by the competent national authorities. 4. For such monitoring, Member States shall conform with Annex II. 5. Member States shall as far as practicable use the reference methods of analysis set out in Annex III. Laboratories using other methods shall ensure that the results thus obtained are equivalent to or comparable with the results obtained by the methods indicated in Annex III. Article 13 Such changes as are necessary for adapting the reference methods of analysis set out in Annex III to scientific and technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15. Article 14 (a) A Committee on the Adaptation to Scientific and Technical Progress, hereinafter called ""the Committee"", is hereby set up ; it shall consist of representatives of the Member States with a representative of the Commission as chairman. (b) The Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure. Article 15 1. Where the procedure laid down in this Article is to be followed, the matter shall be referred to the Committee by its chairman, either on his own initiative or at the request of a representative of a Member State. 2. The representative of the Commission shall submit to the Committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The Committee shall give its opinion on that draft within a time limit set by the chairman having regard to the urgency of the matter. Opinions shall be adopted by a majority of 41 votes, the votes of the Member States being weighted as provided in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty. The chairman shall not vote. 3. (a) Where the measures envisaged are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee, the Commission shall adopt them. (b) Where the measures envisaged are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee, or if no opinion is delivered, the Commission shall without delay submit to the Council a proposal on the measures to be taken. The Council shall act by a qualified majority. (c) If, within three months of the proposal being submitted to it, the Council has not acted, the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Commission. Article 16 Without prejudice to Article 4 (2), Member States may lay down more stringent provisions than those provided for in this Directive for water intended for human consumption. Article 17 Member States may adopt special provisions regarding information - both on packaging or labels and in advertising - concerning a water's suitability for the feeding of infants. Such provisions may also concern the properties of the water which determine the use of the said information. Member States which intend taking such measures shall inform the other Member States and the Commission of them beforehand. Article 18 1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive and its Annexes within two years following its notification. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive. Article 19 The Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the quality of water intended for human consumption complies with this Directive within five years of its notification. Article 20 Member States may, in exceptional cases and for geographically defined population groups, submit a special request to the Commission for a longer period for complying with Annex I. This request, for which grounds must be duly put forward, shall set out the difficulties experienced and must propose an action programme with an appropriate timetable to be undertaken for the improvement of the quality of water intended for human consumption. The Commission shall examine these programmes, including the timetables. In the case of disagreement with the Member State concerned, the Commission shall submit appropriate proposals to the Council.

Article 4 1. The listing particulars shall contain the information which, according to the particular nature of the issuer and of the securities for the admission of which application is being made, is necessary to enable investors and their investment advisers to make an informed assessment of the assets and liabilities, financial position, profits and losses, and prospects of the issuer and of the rights attaching to such securities. 2. Member States shall ensure that the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 is incumbent upon the persons responsible for the listing particulars as provided for in heading 1.1 of Schedules A and B annexed hereto.

Particulars shall also be published of any material changes which have occurred since such document was prepared. The document must be made available to the public at the registered office of the issuer and at the offices of the financial organizations retained to act as the latter's paying agents, and any particulars of material changes shall be published in accordance with Articles 20 (1) and 21 (1). 2. where the securities for which admission to official listing is applied for are: (a) shares allotted free of charge to holders of shares already listed on the same stock exchange ; or (b) shares resulting from the conversion of convertible debt securities or shares created after an exchange for exchangeable debt securities, if shares of the company whose shares are offered by way of conversion or exchange are already listed on the same stock exchange ; or (c) shares resulting from the exercise of the rights conferred by warrants, if shares of the company whose shares are offered to holders of the warrants are already listed on the same stock exchange ; or (d) shares issued in substitution for shares already listed on the same stock exchange if the issuing of such new shares does not involve any increase in the company's issued share capital; and, where appropriate, the information provided for in Chapter 2 of Schedule A is published in accordance with Articles 20 (1) and 21 (1). 3. where the securities for which admission to official listing is applied for are: (a) shares of which either the number or the estimated market value or the nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, the accounting par value, amounts to less than 10 % of the number or of the corresponding value of shares of the same class already listed on the same stock exchange ; or (b) debt securities issued by companies and other legal persons which are nationals of a Member State and which: - in carrying on their business, benefit from State monopolies, and - are set up or governed by a special law or pursuant to such a law or whose borrowings are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by a Member State or one of a Member State's federated States ; or (c) debt securities issued by legal persons, other than companies, which are nationals of a Member State, and - were set up by special law, and - whose activities are governed by that law and consist solely in: (i) raising funds under state control through the issue of debt securities, and (ii) financing production by means of the resources which they have raised and resources provided by a Member State, and - the debt securities of which are, for the purposes of admission to official listing, considered by national law as debt securities issued or guaranteed by the State ; or (d) shares allotted to employees, if shares of the same class have already been admitted to official listing on the same stock exchange ; shares which differ from each other solely as to the date of first entitlement to dividends shall not be considered as being of different classes ; or (e) securities already admitted to official listing on another stock exchange in the same Member State ; or (f) shares issued in consideration for the partial or total renunciation by the management of a limited partnership with a share capital of its statutory rights over the profits, if shares of the same class have already been admitted to official listing on the same stock exchange ; shares which differ from each other solely as to the date of first entitlement to dividends shall not be considered as being of different classes ; or (g) supplementary certificates representing shares issued in exchange for the original securities, where the issuing of such new certificates has not brought about any increase in the company's issued capital, and provided that certificates representing such shares are already listed on the same stock exchange, and where: - in the case of (a), the issuer has complied with the stock exchange publicity requirements imposed by the national authorities and has produced annual accounts and annual and interim reports which these authorities have considered adequate, - in the case of (e), listing particulars complying with this Directive have already been published, and - in all the cases referred to in points (a) to (g), information concerning the number and type of securities to be admitted to official listing and the circumstances in which such securities have been issued has been published in accordance with Articles 20 (1) and 21 (1).

Article 17 1. Where debt securities for which admission to official listing is applied for benefit, as regards both repayment of the loan and the payment of interest, from the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of a State or of one of a State's federated States, national legislation or the competent authorities may authorize the abridgement of the information provided for in Chapters 3 and 5 of Schedule B. 2. The possibility of abridgement provided for in paragraph 1 may also be applied to companies set up or governed by a special law or pursuant to such law which have the power to levy charges on their consumers. SECTION III Arrangements for the scrutiny and publication of listing particulars Article 18 1. Member States shall appoint one or more competent authorities and shall notify the Commission of the appointments of such authorities, giving details of any division of powers among them. Member States shall also ensure that this Directive is applied. 2. No listing particulars may be published until they have been approved by the competent authorities. 3. The competent authorities shall approve the publication of listing particulars only if they are of the opinion that they satisfy all the requirements set out in this Directive. Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities have the powers necessary for them to carry out their task. 4. This Directive shall not affect the competent authorities' liability, which shall continue to be governed solely by the national law. Article 19 The competent authorities shall decide whether to accept the audit report of the official auditor provided for in heading 1.3 of Schedules A and B or, if necessary, to require an additional report. The requirement for the additional report must be the outcome of an examination of each case on its merits. At the request of the official auditor and/or of the issuer, the competent authorities must disclose to them the reasons justifying this requirement. Article 20 1. Listing particulars must be published either: - by insertion in one or more newspapers circulated throughout the Member State in which the admission to official listing of securities is sought, or widely circulated therein, or - in the form of a brochure to be made available, free of charge, to the public at the offices of the stock exchange or stock exchanges on which the securities are being admitted to official listing, at the registered office of the issuer and at the offices of the financial organizations retained to act as the latter's paying agents in the Member State in which the admission of securities to official listing is sought. 2. In addition, either the complete listing particulars or a notice stating where the listing particulars have been published and where they may be obtained by the public must be inserted in a publication designated by the Member State in which the admission of securities to official listing is sought. Article 21 1. Listing particulars must be published within a reasonable period, to be laid down in national legislation or by the competent authorities before the date on which official listing becomes effective. Moreover, where the admission of securities to official listing is preceded by trading of the pre-emptive subscription rights giving rise to dealings recorded in the official list, the listing particulars must be published within a reasonable period, to be laid down by the competent authorities before such trading starts. 2. In exceptional, properly justified cases, the competent authorities may allow the postponement of the publication of the listing particulars until after: - the date on which official listing becomes effective, in the case of securities of a class already listed on the same stock exchange issued in consideration of transfers of assets other than cash, - the date of the opening of trading in pre-emptive subscription rights. 3. If the admission of debt securities to official listing coincides with their public issue and if some of the terms of the issue are not finalized until the last moment, the competent authorities may merely require the publication, within a reasonable period, of listing particulars omitting information as to these terms but indicating how it will be given. Such information must be published before the date on which official listing starts, except where debt securities are issued on a continuous basis at varying prices. Article 22 Where listing particulars are, or will be, published in accordance with Articles 1 and 3 for the admission of securities to official listing, the notices, bills, posters and documents announcing this operation and indicating the essential characteristics of these securities, and all other documents relating to their admission and intended for publication by the issuer or on his behalf, must first be communicated to the competent authorities. The latter shall decide whether they should be submitted to scrutiny before publication. The abovementioned documents must state that listing particulars exist and indicate where they are being, or will be, published in accordance with Article 20. Article 23 Every significant new factor capable of affecting assessment of the securities which arises between the time when the listing particulars are adopted and the time when stock exchange dealings begin shall be covered by a supplement to the listing particulars, scrutinized in the same way as the latter and puplished in accordance with procedures to be laid down by the competent authorities. SECTION IV Cooperation between the Member States Article 24 1. Where applications for admission of the same securities to official listing on stock exchanges situated or operating within several Member States are made simultaneously, or within short intervals of one another, the competent authorities shall exchange information and use their best endeavours to achieve maximum coordination of their requirements concerning listing particulars, to avoid a multiplicity of formalities and to agree to a single text requiring at the most translation, where appropriate, and the issue of supplements as necessary to meet the individual requirements of each Member State concerned. 2. Where an application for admission to official listing is made for securities which have been listed in another Member State less than six months previously, the competent authorities to whom application is made shall contact the competent authorities which have already admitted the securities to official listing and shall, as far as possible, exempt the issuer of those securities from the preparation of new listing particulars, subject to any need for updating, translation or the issue of supplements in accordance with the individual requirements of the Member State concerned. Article 25 1. Member States shall provide that all persons employed or formerly employed by the competent authorities shall be bound by professional secrecy. This means that any confidential information received in the course of their duties may not be divulged to any person or authority except by virtue of provisions laid down by law. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not, however, preclude the competent authorities of the various Member States from exchanging information as provided for in this Directive. Information thus exchanged shall be covered by the obligation of professional secrecy to which the persons employed or formerly employed by the competent authorities receiving the information are subject. SECTION V Contact Committee Article 26 1. The Contact Committee set up by Article 20 of Council Directive 79/279/EEC of 5 March 1979 coordinating the conditions for the admission of securities to official stock exchange listing (1) shall also have as its function: (a) without prejudice to Articles 169 and 170 of the EEC Treaty to facilitate the harmonized implementation of this Directive through regular consultations on any practical problems arising from its application on which exchanges of views are deemed useful; (b) to facilitate consultation between the Member States on the supplements and improvements to the listing particulars which the competent authorities are entitled to require or recommend at national level; (c) to advise the Commission, if necessary, on any additions or amendments to be made to this Directive. 2. It shall not be the function of the Contact Committee to appraise the merits of decisions taken by the competent authorities in individual cases.

If the academic title used in the Member State of origin, or in the Member State from which a foreign national comes, can be confused in the host Member State with a title requiring in that State additional training which the person concerned has not undergone, the host Member State may require such person to use the title employed in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which he comes in suitable wording to be indicated by the host Member State. CHAPTER V PROVISIONS TO FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF ESTABLISHMENT AND FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN RESPECT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF VETERINARY SURGEONS A. Provisions specifically relating to the right of establishment Article 6 1. A host Member State which requires of its nationals proof of good character or good repute when they take up for the first time the activities referred to in Article 1 shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of other Member States, a certificate issued by a competent authority in the Member State of origin or in the Member State from which the foreign national comes attesting that the requirements of the Member State as to good character or good repute for taking up the activities in question have been met. 2. Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not require proof of good character or good repute of persons wishing to take up the activities in question for the first time, the host Member State may require of nationals of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes an extract from the ""judicial record"" or, failing this, an equivalent document issued by a competent authority in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes. 3. If the host Member State has detailed knowledge of a serious matter which has occurred outside its territory and which is likely to affect the taking up within its territory of the activities concerned, it may inform the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes. The Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes shall verify the accuracy of the facts. The authorities in that State shall themselves decide on the nature and extent of the investigation to be made and shall inform the host Member State of any consequential action which they take with regard to the certificates or documents they have issued. 4. Member States shall ensure the confidentiality of the information which is forwarded. Article 7 1. Where, in a host Member State, provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action are in force laying down requirements as to good character or good repute, including provisions for disciplinary action in respect of serious professional misconduct or conviction for criminal offences and relating to the pursuit of the activities referred to in Article 1, the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes shall forward to the host Member State all necessary information regarding measures or disciplinary action of a professional or administrative nature taken in respect of the person concerned, or criminal penalties imposed on him when pursuing his profession in the Member State of origin or in the Member State from which he came. 2. If the host Member State has detailed knowledge of a serious matter which has occurred outside its territory and which is likely to affect the pursuit within its territory of the activities concerned, it may inform the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes. The Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes shall verify the accuracy of the facts. The authorities in that State shall themselves decide on the nature and extent of the investigation to be made and shall inform the host Member State of any consequential action which they take with regard to the information they have forwarded in accordance with paragraph 1. 3. Member States shall ensure the confidentiality of the information which is forwarded. Article 8 Where a host Member State requires of its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue the activities referred to in Article 1, a certificate of physical or mental health, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence thereof the presentation of the document required in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes. Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not impose any requirements of this nature on those wishing to take up or pursue the activities in question, the host Member State shall accept from such national a certificate issued by a competent authority in that State corresponding to the certificates issued in the host Member State. Article 9 The documents referred to in Articles 6, 7 and 8 may not be presented more than three months after their date of issue. Article 10 1. The procedure for authorizing the person concerned to take up the activities referred to in Article 1, in accordance with Articles 6, 7 and 8, must be completed as soon as possible and not later than three months after presentation of all the documents relating to such person, without prejudice to delays resulting from any appeal that may be made upon termination of this procedure. 2. In the cases referred to in Articles 6 (3) and 7 (2), a request for re-examination shall suspend the period laid down in paragraph 1. The Member State consulted shall give its reply within a period of three months. If it does not, the host Member State may take action in consequence of its detailed knowledge of the serious matter involved. On receipt of the reply or at the end of the period the host Member State shall continue with the procedure referred to in paragraph 1. Article 11 Where a host Member State requires its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue the activities referred to in Article 1 to take an oath or make a solemn declaration and where the form of such oath or declaration cannot be used by nationals of other Member States, that Member State shall ensure that an appropriate and equivalent form of oath or declaration is offered to the person concerned. B. Special provisions relating to the provision of services Article 12 1. Where a Member State requires of its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue the activities referred to in Article 1, an authorization or membership of, or registration with, a professional organization or body, that Member State shall in the case of the provision of services exempt the nationals of Member States from that requirement. The person concerned shall provide services with the same rights and obligations as the nationals of the host Member State ; in particular he shall be subject to the rules of conduct of a professional or administrative nature which apply in that Member State. For this purpose and in addition to the declaration provided for in paragraph 2 relating to the services to be provided, Member States may, so as to permit the implementation of the provisions relating to professional conduct in force in their territory, require either automatic temporary registration or pro forma membership of a professional organization or body or, in the alternative, registration in a register, provided that such registration or membership does not delay or in any way complicate the provision of services or impose any additional costs on the person providing the services. Where a host Member State adopts a measure pursuant to the second subparagraph or becomes aware of facts which run counter to these provisions, it shall forthwith inform the Member State where the person concerned is established. 2. The host Member State may require the person concerned to make a prior declaration to the competent authorities concerning the provision of his services where they involve a temporary stay in its territory. The host Member State may in all cases require a veterinary surgeon established in another Member State to supply a prior declaration of provision of services in the form of a prescription or of veterinary certificates not involving the examination of animals, provided such practice is permissible under the legal and administrative provisions and professional rules applied in the host State. The host Member State requiring such prior declaration shall take the steps necessary to provide the possibility that the declaration is made, where appropriate, for a series of services provided within one and the same region and in respect of one or more recipients within a given period of not more than one year. In urgent cases this declaration may be made as soon as possible after the services have been provided. 3. Pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2, the host Member State may require the person concerned to supply one or more documents containing the following particulars: - the declaration referred to in paragraph 2, - a certificate stating that the person concerned is lawfully pursuing the activities in question in the Member State where he is established, - a certificate that the person concerned holds one or other of the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualification appropriate for the provision of the services in question and referred to in this Directive. 4. The document or documents specified in paragraph 3 may not be produced more than 12 months after their date of issue. 5. Where a Member State temporarily or permanently deprives, in whole or in part, one of its nationals or a national of another Member State established in its territory of the right to pursue one of the activities referred to in Article 1, it shall, as appropriate, ensure the temporary or permanent withdrawal of the certificate referred to in the second indent of paragraph 3. C. Provisions common to the right of establishment and freedom to provide services Article 13 Where in a host Member State the use of the professional title relating to the activities referred to in Article 1 is subject to rules, nationals of other Member States who fulfil the conditions laid down in Articles 2 and 4 shall use the professional title of the host Member State which, in that State, corresponds to those conditions of qualification and shall use the abbreviated title. Article 14 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to enable the persons concerned to obtain information on veterinary legislation and, where applicable, on professional ethics by the host Member State. For this purpose, Member States may set up information centres from which such persons may obtain the necessary information. In the case of establishment, the host Member States may require the persons concerned to contact these centres. 2. Member States may set up the centres referred to in paragraph 1 within the competent authorities and bodies which they must designate within the period laid down in Article 18 (1). 3. Member States shall see to it that, where appropriate, the persons concerned acquire, in their interest and in that of their clients, the linguistic knowledge necessary for the pursuit of their profession in the host Member State. CHAPTER VI FINAL PROVISIONS Article 15 When it has ground for doubt, the host Member State may require of the competent authorities of another Member State confirmation of the authenticity of the diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications awarded in that other Member State and referred to in Chapter II and also confirmation of the fact that the person concerned has fulfilled all the training requirements laid down in Directive 78/1027/EEC.

Article 7 1. A merger shall require at least the approval of the general meeting of each of the merging companies. The laws of the Member States shall provide that this decision shall require a majority of not less than two thirds of the votes attaching either to the shares or to the subscribed capital represented.

Moreover, where appropriate, the rules governing alterations to the memorandum and articles of association shall apply. 2. Where there is more than one class of shares, the decision concerning a merger shall be subject to a separate vote by at least each class of shareholders whose rights are affected by the transaction. 3. The decision shall cover both the approval of the draft terms of merger and any alterations to the memorandum and articles of association necessitated by the merger. Article 8 The laws of a Member State need not require approval of the merger by the general meeting of the acquiring company if the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the publication provided for in Article 6 must be effected, for the acquiring company, at least one month before the date fixed for the general meeting of the company or companies being acquired which are to decide on the draft terms of merger; (b) at least one month before the date specified in (a), all shareholders of the acquiring company must be entitled to inspect the documents specified in Article 11 (1) at the registered office of the acquiring company; (c) one or more shareholders of the acquiring company holding a minimum percentage of the subscribed capital must be entitled to require that a general meeting of the acquiring company be called to decide whether to approve the merger. This minimum percentage may not be fixed at more than 5 %. The Member States may, however, provide for the exclusion of non-voting shares from this calculation. Article 9 The administration or management bodies of each of the merging companies shall draw up a detailed written report explaining the draft terms of merger and setting out the legal and economic grounds for them, in particular the share exchange ratio. The report shall also describe any special valuation difficulties which have arisen. Article 10 1. One or more experts, acting on behalf of each of the merging companies but independent of them, appointed or approved by a judicial or administrative authority, shall examine the draft terms of merger and draw up a written report to the shareholders. However, the laws of a Member State may provide for the appointment of one or more independent experts for all the merging companies, if such appointment is made by a judicial or administrative authority at the joint request of those companies. Such experts may, depending on the laws of each Member State, be natural or legal persons or companies or firms. 2.

To this end, the laws of the Member States shall at least provide that such creditors shall be entitled to obtain adequate safeguards where the financial situation of the merging companies makes such protection necessary and where those creditors do not already have such safeguards. 3. Such protection may be different for the creditors of the acquiring company and for those of the company being acquired. Article 14 Without prejudice to the rules governing the collective exercise of their rights, Article 13 shall apply to the debenture holders of the merging companies, except where the merger has been approved by a meeting of the debenture holders, if such a meeting is provided for under national laws, or by the debenture holders individually. Article 15 Holders of securities, other than shares, to which special rights are attached, must be given rights in the acquiring company at least equivalent to those they possessed in the company being acquired, unless the alteration of those rights has been approved by a meeting of the holders of such securities, if such a meeting is provided for under national laws, or by the holders of those securities individually, or unless the holders are entitled to have their securities repurchased by the acquiring company.

In cases where the merger need not be approved by the general meetings of all the merging companies, the draft terms of merger must be drawn up and certified in due legal form. 2. The notary or the authority competent to draw up and certify the document in due legal form must check and certify the existence and validity of the legal acts and formalities required of the company for which he or it is acting and of the draft terms of merger. Article 17 The laws of the Member States shall determine the date on which a merger takes effect. Article 18 1.

No shares in the acquiring company shall be exchanged for shares in the company being acquired held either: (a) by the acquiring company itself or through a person acting in his own name but on its behalf; or (b) by the company being acquired itself or through a person acting in his own name but on its behalf. 3. The foregoing shall not affect the laws of Member States which require the completion of special formalities for the transfer of certain assets, rights and obligations by the acquired company to be effective as against third parties. The acquiring company may carry out these formalities itself ; however, the laws of the Member States may permit the company being acquired to continue to carry out these formalities for a limited period which cannot, save in exceptional cases, be fixed at more than six months from the date on which the merger takes effect. Article 20 The laws of the Member States shall at least lay down rules governing the civil liability towards the shareholders of the company being acquired of the members of the administrative or management bodies of that company in respect of misconduct on the part of members of those bodies in preparing and implementing the merger. Article 21 The laws of the Member States shall at least lay down rules governing the civil liability towards the shareholders of the company being acquired of the experts responsible for drawing up on behalf of that company the report referred to in Article 10 (1) in respect of misconduct on the part of those experts in the performance of their duties. Article 22 1. The laws of the Member States may lay down nullity rules for mergers in accordance with the following conditions only: (a) nullity must be ordered in a court judgment; (b) mergers which have taken effect pursuant to Article 17 may be declared void only if there has been no judicial or administrative preventive supervision of their legality, or if they have not been drawn up and certified in due legal form, or if it is shown that the decision of the general meeting is void or voidable under national law; (c) nullification proceedings may not be initiated more than six months after the date on which the merger becomes effective as against the person alleging nullity or if the situation has been rectified; (d) where it is possible to remedy a defect liable to render a merger void, the competent court shall grant the companies involved a period of time within which to rectify the situation; (e) a judgment declaring a merger void shall be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC; (f) where the laws of a Member State permit a third party to challenge such a judgment, he may do so only within six months of publication of the judgment in the manner prescribed by Directive 68/151/EEC; (g) a judgment declaring a merger void shall not of itself affect the validity of obligations owed by or in relation to the acquiring company which arose before the judgment was published and after the date referred to in Article 17; (h) companies which have been parties to a merger shall be jointly and severally liable in respect of the obligations of the acquiring company referred to in (g). 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 (a), the laws of a Member State may also provide for the nullity of a merger to be ordered by an administrative authority if an appeal against such a decision lies to a court. Subparagraphs (b), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) shall apply by analogy to the administrative authority. Such nullification proceedings may not be initiated more than six months after the date referred to in Article 17. 3.

Article 27 In cases of merger where one or more companies are acquired by another company which holds 90 % or more, but not all, of the shares and other securities of each of those companies the holding of which confers the right to vote at general meetings, the Member States need not require approval of the merger by the general meeting of the acquiring company, provided that the following conditions at least are fulfilled: (a) the publication provided for in Article 6 must be effected, as regards the acquiring company, at least one month before the date fixed for the general meeting of the company or companies being acquired which is to decide on the draft terms of merger; (b) at least one month before the date specified in (a), all shareholders of the acquiring company must be entitled to inspect the documents specified in Article 11 (1) (a), (b) and (c) at the company's registered office. Article 11 (2) and (3) must apply; (c) Article 8 (c) must apply. Article 28 The Member States need not apply Articles 9 to 11 to a merger within the meaning of Article 27 if the following conditions at least are fulfilled: (a) the minority shareholders of the company being acquired must be entitled to have their shares acquired by the acquiring company; (b) if they exercise that right, they must be entitled to receive consideration corresponding to the value of their shares; (c) in the event of disagreement regarding such consideration, it must be possible for the value of the consideration to be determined by a court.

CHAPTER VI Final provisions Article 32 1. The Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary for them to comply with this Directive within three years of its notification.

However, provision may be made for a delay of five years from the entry into force of the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 for the application of those provisions to unregistered companies in the United Kingdom and Ireland. 3. The Member States need not apply Articles 13, 14 and 15 as regards the holders of convertible debentures and other convertible securities if, at the time when the laws, regulations and administrative provisions referred to in paragraph 1 come into force, the position of these holders in the event of a merger has previously been determined by the conditions of issue. 4. The Member States need not apply this Directive to mergers or to operations treated as mergers for the preparation or execution of which an act or formality required by national law has already been completed when the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 enter into force.

Article 6 1. Nationals of Member States wishing to acquire one of the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualification of practitioner of specialized dentistry which are not awarded in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes, may be required by a host Member State to fulfil the conditions of training laid down in respect of the speciality by its own laws, regulations or administrative provisions. 2. The host Member State shall, however, take into account, in whole or in part, the training periods completed by the nationals referred to in paragraph 1 and attested by possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal training awarded by the competent authorities of the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes, provided such training periods correspond to those required in the host Member State for the specialized training in question. 3. The competent authorities or bodies of the host Member State, having verified the content and duration of the specialist training of the person concerned on the basis of the diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications submitted, shall inform him of the period of additional training required and of the fields to be covered by it. CHAPTER IV EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES Article 7 1. In the case of nationals of Member States whose diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications do not satisfy all the minimum training requirements laid down in Article 1 of Directive 78/687/EEC, each Member State shall recognize as being sufficient proof the diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in dentistry awarded by those Member States before the implementation of Directive 78/687/EEC, accompanied by a certificate stating that those nationals have effectively and lawfully been engaged in the activities in question for at least three consecutive years during the five years prior to the date of issue of the certificate. 2. In the case of nationals of Member States whose diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in specialized dentistry do not satisfy the minimum training requirements under Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 78/687/EEC, each Member State shall recognize as sufficient proof the diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in specialized dentistry awarded by those Member States before the implementation of Directive 78/687/EEC.

However, if before this Directive is implemented, the host Member State requires a minimum training period of shorter duration than that referred to in Article 2 of Directive 78/687/EEC, the difference mentioned in the first subparagraph can be determined only by reference to the minimum training period laid down by that State. CHAPTER V USE OF ACADEMIC TITLE Article 8 1. Without prejudice to Article 17, host Member States shall ensure that the nationals of Member States who fulfil the conditions laid down in Articles 2, 4, 7 and 19 have the right to use the lawful academic title in so far as this is not identical with the professional title or, where appropriate, the abbreviation thereof, of their Member State of origin or of the Member State from which they come, in the language of that State. Host Member States may require this title to be followed by the name and location of the establishment or examining board which awarded it. 2. If the academic title used in the Member State of origin or in the Member State from which a foreign national comes can be confused in the host Member State with a title requiring in that State additional training which the person concerned has not undergone, the host Member State may require such a person to use the title employed in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which he comes in suitable wording to be drawn up by the host Member State. CHAPTER VI PROVISIONS TO FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF ESTABLISHMENT AND FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN RESPECT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF DENTAL PRACTITIONERS A. Provisions relating specifically to the right of establishment Article 9 1.

Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not require proof of good character or good repute of persons wishing to take up the activity in question for the first time, the host Member State may require of nationals of the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes an extract from the ""judicial record"" or, failing this, an equivalent document issued by a competent authority in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes. 3. If the host Member State has detailed knowledge of a serious matter which has occurred prior to the establishment of the person concerned in that State outside its territory and which is likely to affect the taking up within its territory of the activity concerned, it may inform the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes. The Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes shall verify the accuracy of the facts if they are likely to affect in that Member State the taking up of the activity in question. The authorities in that State shall decide on the nature and extent of the investigation to be made and shall inform the host Member State of any consequential action which they take with regard to the certificates or documents they have issued. 4. Member States shall ensure the confidentiality of the information forwarded. Article 10 1. Where, in a host Member State, provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action are in force laying down requirements as to good character or good repute, including provision for disciplinary action in the event of serious professional misconduct or conviction for criminal offences and relating to the pursuit of any of the activities referred to in Article 1, the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes shall forward to the host Member State all necessary information regarding measures or disciplinary action of a professional or administrative nature taken in respect of the person concerned or regarding criminal penalties imposed on him when pursuing his profession in the Member State of origin or in the Member State from which he comes. 2. If the host Member State has detailed knowledge of a serious matter which has occurred prior to the establishment of the person concerned in the State outside its territory and which is likely to affect the pursuit within its territory of the activity concerned, it may inform the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes. The Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes shall verify the accuracy of the facts if they are likely to affect in that Member State the pursuit of the activity in question. The authorities in that State shall decide on the nature and extent of the investigation to be made and shall inform the host Member State of any consequential action which they take with regard to the information they have forwarded in accordance with paragraph 1. 3. Member States shall ensure the confidentiality of the information forwarded.

Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not impose any requirements of this nature on those wishing to take up or pursue the activity in question, the host Member State shall accept from such national a certificate issued by a competent authority in that State corresponding to the certificates issued in the host Member State. Article 12 Documents issued in accordance with Articles 9, 10 and 11 may not be presented more than three months after their date of issue. Article 13 1.

In the cases referred to in Articles 9 (3) and 10 (2), a request for re-examination shall suspend the period laid down in paragraph 1. The Member State consulted shall give its reply within a period of three months. On receipt of the reply or at the end of the period the host Member State shall continue with the procedure referred to in paragraph 1. Article 14 Where a host Member State requires its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue any of the activities referred to in Article 1 to take an oath or make a solemn declaration and where the form of such oath or declaration cannot be used by nationals of other Member States, that Member State shall ensure that an appropriate and equivalent form of oath or declaration is offered to the person concerned. B. Provisions relating specifically to the provision of services Article 15 1. Where a Member State requires of its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue any of the activities referred to in Article 1 an authorization or membership of or registration with a professional organization or body, that Member State shall in the case of the provision of services exempt the nationals of the other Member States from that requirement. The person concerned shall provide services with the same rights and obligations as the nationals of the host Member State ; in particular he shall be subject to the rules of conduct of a professional or administrative nature which apply in that Member State. To this end and in addition to the declaration relating to the provision of services referred to in paragraph 2 Member States may, so as to permit the implementation of the provisions relating to professional conduct in force in their territory, provide for automatic temporary registration with or pro forma membership of a professional organization or body or entry in a register, provided that such registration does not delay or in any way complicate the provision of services or impose any additional costs on the person providing the services. Where a host Member State adopts a measure pursuant to the second subparagraph or becomes aware of facts which run counter to these provisions, it shall forthwith inform the Member State where the person concerned is established. 2. The host Member State may require the person concerned to make a prior declaration to the competent authorities concerning the provision of his services where they involve a temporary stay in its territory.

Where a Member State temporarily or permanently deprives, in whole or in part, one of its nationals or a national of another Member State established in its territory of the right to pursue any of the activities referred to in Article 1, it shall, as appropriate, ensure the temporary or permanent withdrawal of the certificate referred to in the second indent of paragraph 3. Article 16 Where registration with a public social security body is required in a host Member State for the settlement with insurance bodies of accounts relating to services rendered to persons insured under social security schemes, that Member State shall exempt nationals of Member States established in another Member State from this requirement in cases of provision of services entailing travel on the part of the person concerned. In all cases of provision of services entailing travel on the part of the person concerned, the host Member State may require him to supply information to this body in advance, or, in urgent cases, at the earliest opportunity, concerning the services provided. C. Provisions common to the right of establishment and freedom to provide services Article 17 1. Where in a host Member State the use of the professional title relating to any of the activities referred to in Article 1 is subject to rules, nationals of other Member States who fulfil the conditions laid down in Articles 2, 7 (1) and 19 shall use the professional title of the host Member State which, in that State, corresponds to those conditions of qualification and shall use the abbreviated title. 2. Paragraph 1 shall also apply to the use of professional titles of practitioner of specialized dentistry by those who fulfil the conditions laid down in Articles 4 and 7 (2) respectively. Article 18 1.

The Member States shall require persons wishing to take up and pursue a dental profession under the titles referred to in Article 1 of Directive 78/686/EEC to hold a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications referred to in Article 3 of the same Directive which guarantees that during his complete training period the person concerned has acquired: (a) adequate knowledge of the sciences on which dentistry is based and a good understanding of scientific methods, including the principles of measuring biological functions, the evaluation of scientifically established facts and the analysis of data; (b) adequate knowledge of the constitution, physiology and behaviour of healthy and sick persons as well as the influence of the natural and social environment on the state of health of the human being, in so far as these factors affect dentistry; (c) adequate knowledge of the structure and function of the teeth, mouth, jaws and associated tissues, both healthy and diseased, and their relationship to the general state of health and to the physical and social well-being of the patient; (d) adequate knowledge of clinical disciplines and methods, providing the dentist with a coherent picture of anomalies, lesions and diseases of the teeth, mouth, jaws and associated tissues and of preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic dentistry; (e) suitable clinical experience under appropriate supervision. This training shall provide him with the skills necessary for carrying out all activities involving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of anomalies and diseases of the teeth, mouth, jaws and associated tissues. 2. A complete period of dental training of this kind shall comprise at least a five-year full time course of theoretical and practical instruction given in a university, in a higher-education institution recognized as having equivalent status or under the supervision of a university and shall include the subjects listed in the Annex. 3. In order to be accepted for such training, the candidate must have a diploma or a certificate which entitles him to be admitted for the course of study concerned to the universities of a Member State or to the higher education institutions recognized as having equivalent status. 4. Nothing in this Directive shall prejudice any facility which may be granted in accordance with their own rules by Member States in respect of their own territory to authorize holders of diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications which have not been obtained in a Member State to take up and pursue the activities of a dental practitioner. Article 2 1. Member States shall ensure that the training leading to a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications as a practitioner of specialized dentistry meets the following requirements at least: (a) it shall entail the completion and validation of a five-year full-time course of theoretical and practical instruction within the framework of the training referred to in Article 1, or possession of the documents referred to in Article 7 (1) of Directive 78/686/EEC. (b) it shall comprise theoretical and practical instruction; (c) it shall be a full-time course of a minimum of three years' duration supervised by the competent authorities or bodies; (d) it shall be in a university centre, in a treatment, teaching and research centre or, where appropriate, in a health establishment approved for this purpose by the competent authorities or bodies; (e) it shall involve the personal participation of the dental practitioner training to be a specialist in the activity and in the responsibilities of the establishments concerned. 2. Member States shall make the award of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications as a practitioner of specialized dentistry subject to the possession of one of the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications in dentistry referred to in Article 1, or to the possession of the documents referred to in Article 7 (1) of Directive 78/686/EEC. 3. Within the time limit laid down in Article 8 Member States shall designate the authorities or bodies competent to issue the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications referred to in paragraph 1. 4. Member States may derogate from paragraph 1 (a). Persons in respect of whom such derogation is made shall not be entitled to avail themselves of Article 4 of Directive 78/686/EEC. Article 3 1. Without prejudice to the principle of full-time training as set out in Article 2 (1) (c), and until such time as the Council takes a decision in accordance with paragraph 3, Member States may permit part-time specialist training, under conditions approved by the competent national authorities, when training on a full-time basis would not be practicable for well-founded reasons. 2. The total period of specialized training may not be shortened by virtue of paragraph 1. The standard of the training may not be impaired, either by its part-time nature or by the practice of private, remunerated professional activity. 3. Four years at the latest after notification of this Directive and in the light of a review of the situation, acting on a proposal from the Commission, and bearing in mind that the possibility of part-time training should continue to exist in certain circumstances to be examined separately for each specialization, the Council shall decide whether the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 should be retained or amended. Article 4 As a transitional measure and notwithstanding Articles 2 (1) (c) and 3, Member States whose provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action permit a method of part-time specialist training at the time of notification of this Directive may continue to apply these provisions to candidates who have begun their training as specialists no later than four years after the notification of this Directive. This period may be extended if the Council has not taken a decision in accordance with Article 3 (3). CHAPTER II FIELD OF ACTIVITY Article 5 Member States shall ensure that dental surgeons shall generally be entitled to take up and pursue activities involving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of anomalies and diseases of the teeth, mouth, jaws and associated tissues in accordance with the regulatory provisions and the rules of professional conduct governing the profession at the time of notification of this Directive. Those Member States which do not have such provisions or rules may define or limit the pursuit of certain activities referred to in the first subparagraph to an extent which is comparable to that existing in the other Member States. CHAPTER III FINAL PROVISIONS Article 6 Persons covered by Article 19 of Directive 78/686/EEC shall be regarded as fulfilling the requirements laid down in Article 2 (1) (a). For the purposes of applying Article 2 (2), persons covered by Article 19 of Directive 78/686/EEC shall be treated in the same way as those holding one of the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications in dentistry referred to in Article 1. Article 7 This Directive shall also apply to nationals of Member States who, in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (1), are or will be pursuing, as employed persons, any of the activities referred to in Article 1 of Directive 78/686/EEC.

Article 29 1. Income and charges that arise otherwise than in the course of the company's ordinary activities must be shown under ""Extraordinary income and extraordinary charges"". 2. Unless the income and charges referred to in paragraph 1 are immaterial for the assessment of the results, explanations of their amount and nature must be given in the notes on the accounts.

Article 30 The Member States may permit taxes on the profit or loss on ordinary activities and taxes on the extraordinary profit or loss to be shown in total as one item in the profit and loss account before ""Other taxes not shown under the above items"". In that case, ""Profit or loss on ordinary activities after taxation"" shall be omitted from the layouts prescribed in Articles 23 to 26. Where this derogation is applied, companies must disclose in the notes on the accounts the extent to which the taxes on the profit or loss affect the profit or loss on ordinary activities and the ""Extraordinary profit or loss"". SECTION 7 Valuation rules Article 31 1. The Member States shall ensure that the items shown in the annual accounts are valued in accordance with the following general principles: (a) the company must be presumed to be carrying on its business as a going concern; (b) the methods of valuation must be applied consistently from one financial year to another; (c) valuation must be made on a prudent basis, and in particular: (aa) only profits made at the balance sheet date may be included, (bb) account must be taken of all foreseeable liabilities and potential losses arising in the course of the financial year concerned or of a previous one, even if such liabilities or losses become apparent only between the date of the balance sheet and the date on which it is drawn up, (cc) account must be taken of all depreciation, whether the result of the financial year is a loss or a profit; (d) account must be taken of income and charges relating to the financial year, irrespective of the date of receipt or payment of such income or charges; (e) the components of asset and liability items must be valued separately; (f) the opening balance sheet for each financial year must correspond to the closing balance sheet for the preceding financial year. 2. Departures from these general principles shall be permitted in exceptional cases. Any such departures must be disclosed in the notes on the accounts and the reasons for them given together with an assessment of their effect on the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. Article 32 The items shown in the annual accounts shall be valued in accordance with Articles 34 to 42, which are based on the principle of purchase price or production cost. Article 33 1. The Member States may declare to the Commission that they reserve the power, by way of derogation from Article 32 and pending subsequent coordination, to permit or require in respect of all companies or any classes of companies: (a) valuation by the replacement value method for tangible fixed assets with limited useful economic lives and for stocks; (b) valuation by methods other than that provided for in (a) which are designed to take account of inflation for the items shown in annual accounts, including capital and reserves; (c) revaluation of tangible fixed assets and financial fixed assets. Where national law provides for valuation methods as indicated in (a), (b) and (c), it must define their content and limits and the rules for their application. The application of any such method, the balance sheet and profit and loss account items concerned and the method by which the values shown are calculated shall be disclosed in the notes on the accounts. 2. (a) Where paragraph 1 is applied, the amount of the difference between valuation by the method used and valuation in accordance with the general rule laid down in Article 32 must be entered in the revaluation reserve under ""Liabilities"". The treatment of this item for taxation purposes must be explained either in the balance sheet or in the notes on the accounts. For purposes of the application of the last subparagraph of paragraph 1, companies shall, whenever the amount of the reserve has been changed in the course of the financial year, publish in the notes on the accounts inter alia a table showing: - the amount of the revaluation reserve at the beginning of the financial year, - the revaluation differences transferred to the revaluation reserve during the financial year, - the amounts capitalized or otherwise transferred from the revaluation reserve during the financial year, the nature of any such transfer being disclosed, - the amount of the revaluation reserve at the end of the financial year. (b) The revaluation reserve may be capitalized in whole or in part at any time. (c) The revaluation reserve must be reduced to the extent that the amounts transferred thereto are no longer necessary for the implementation of the valuation method used and the achievement of its purpose. The Member States may lay down rules governing the application of the revaluation reserve, provided that transfers to the profit and loss account from the revaluation reserve may be made only to the extent that the amounts transferred have been entered as charges in the profit and loss account or reflect increases in value which have been actually realized. These amounts must be disclosed separately in the profit and loss account. No part of the revaluation reserve may be distributed, either directly or indirectly, unless it represents gains actually realized. (d) Save as provided under (b) and (c) the revaluation reserve may not be reduced. 3. Value adjustments shall be calculated each year on the basis of the value adopted for the financial year in question, save that by way of derogation from Articles 4 and 22, the Member States may permit or require that only the amount of the value adjustments arising as a result of the application of the general rule laid down in Article 32 be shown under the relevant items in the layouts prescribed in Articles 23 to 26 and that the difference arising as a result of the valuation method adopted under this Article be shown separately in the layouts. Furthermore, Articles 34 to 42 shall apply mutatis mutandis. 4. Where paragraph 1 is applied, the following must be disclosed, either in the balance sheet or in the notes on the accounts, separately for each balance sheet item as provided for in the layouts prescribed in Articles 9 and 10, except for stocks, either: (a) the amount at the balance sheet date of the valuation made in accordance with the general rule laid down in Article 32 and the amount of the cumulative value adjustments ; or (b) the amount at the balance sheet date of the difference between the valuation made in accordance with this Article and that resulting from the application of Article 32 and, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of the additional value adjustments. 5. Without prejudice to Article 52 the Council shall, on a proposal from the Commission and within seven years of the notification of this Directive, examine and, where necessary, amend this Article in the light of economic and monetary trends in the Community. Article 34 1. (a) Where national law authorizes the inclusion of formation expenses under ""Assets"", they must be written off within a maximum period of five years. (b) In so far as formation expenses have not been completely written off, no distribution of profits shall take place unless the amount of the reserves available for distribution and profits brought forward is at least equal to that of the expenses not written off. 2. The amounts entered under ""Formation expenses"" must be explained in the notes on the accounts. Article 35 1. (a) Fixed assets must be valued at purchase price or production cost, without prejudice to (b) and (c) below. (b) The purchase price or production cost of fixed assets with limited useful economic lives must be reduced by value adjustments calculated to write off the value of such assets systematically over their useful economic lives. (c) (aa) Value adjustments may be made in respect of financial fixed assets, so that they are valued at the lower figure to be attributed to them at the balance sheet date. (bb) Value adjustments must be made in, respect of fixed assets, whether their useful economic lives are limited or not, so that they are valued at the lower figure to be attributed to them at the balance sheet date if it is expected that the reduction in their value will be permanent. (cc) The value adjustments referred to in (aa) and (bb) must be charged to the profit and loss account and disclosed separately in the notes on the accounts if they have not been shown separately in the profit and loss account. (dd) Valuation at the lower of the values provided for in (aa) and (bb) may not be continued if the reasons for which the value adjustments were made have ceased to apply. (d) If fixed assets are the subject of exceptional value adjustments for taxation purposes alone, the amount of the adjustments and the reasons for making them shall be indicated in the notes on the accounts. 2. The purchase price shall be calculated by adding to the price paid the expenses incidental thereto. 3. (a) The production cost shall be calculated by adding to the purchasing price of the raw materials and consumables the costs directly attributable to the product in question. (b) A reasonable proportion of the costs which are only indirectly attributable to the product in question may be added into the production costs to the extent that they relate to the period of production. 4. Interest on capital borrowed to finance the production of fixed assets may be included in the production costs to the extent that it relates to the period of production. In that event, the inclusion of such interest under ""Assets"" must be disclosed in the notes on the accounts. Article 36 By way of derogation from Article 35 (1) (c) (cc), the Member States may allow investment companies within the meaning of Article 5 (2) to set off value adjustments to investments directly against ""Capital and reserves"". The amounts in question must be shown separately under ""Liabilities"" in the balance sheet. Article 37 1. Article 34 shall apply to costs of research and development. In exceptional cases, however, the Member States may permit derogations from Article 34 (1) (a). In that case, they may also provide for derogations from Article 34 (1) (b). Such derogations and the reasons for them must be disclosed in the notes on the accounts. 2. Article 34 (1) (a) shall apply to goodwill. The Member States may, however, permit companies to write goodwill off systematically over a limited period exceeding five years provided that this period does not exceed the useful economic life of the asset and is disclosed in the notes on the accounts together with the supporting reasons therefore. Article 38 Tangible fixed assets, raw materials and consumables which are constantly being replaced and the overall value of which is of secondary importance to the undertaking may he shown under ""Assets"" at a fixed quantity and value, if the quantity, value and composition thereof do not vary materially. Article 39 1. (a) Current assets must be valued at purchase price or production cost, without prejudice to (b) and (c) below. (b) Value adjustments shall be made in respect of current assets with a view to showing them at the lower market value or, in particular circumstances, another lower value to be attributed to them at the balance sheet date. (c) The Member States may permit exceptional value adjustments where, on the basis of a reasonable commercial assessment, these are necessary if the valuation of these items is not to be modified in the near future because of fluctuations in value. The amount of these value adjustments must be disclosed separately in the profit and loss account or in the notes on the accounts. (d) Valuation at the lower value provided for in (b) and (c) may not be continued if the reasons for which the value adjustments were made have ceased to apply. (e) If current assets are the subject of exceptional value adjustments for taxation purposes alone, the amount of the adjustments and the reasons for making them must he disclosed in the notes on the accounts. 2. The definitions of purchase price and of production cost given in Article 35 (2) and (3) shall apply. The Member States may also apply Article 35 (4). Distribution costs may not be included in production costs. Article 40 1. The Member States may permit the purchase price or production cost of stocks of goods of the same category and all fungible items including investments to be calculated either on the basis of weighted average prices or by the ""first in, first out"" (FIFO) method, the ""last in, first out"" (LIFO) method, or some similar method. 2. Where the value shown in the balance sheet, following application of the methods of calculation specified in paragraph 1, differs materially, at the balance sheet date, from the value on the basis of the last known market value prior to the balance sheet date, the amount of that difference must be disclosed in total by category in the notes on the accounts. Article 41 1. Where the amount repayable on account of any debt is greater than the amount received, the difference may be shown as an asset. It must be shown separately in the balance sheet or in the notes on the accounts. 2. The amount of this difference must be written off by a reasonable amount each year and completely written off no later than the time of repayment of the debt. Article 42 Provisions for liabilities and charges may not exceed in amount the sums which are necessary.

In addition to the information required under other provisions of this Directive, the notes on the accounts must set out information in respect of the following matters at least: (1) the valuation methods applied to the various items in the annual accounts, and the methods employed in calculating the value adjustments.

This Directive shall apply to Community co-insurance operations referred to in Article 2 which relate to risks classified under point A. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 16 of the Annex to the First Council Directive of 24 July 1973 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking-up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance other than life assurance (4), hereinafter called the ""first Coordination Directive"". It shall not apply, however, to Community co-insurance operations covering risks classified under point A. 13 which concern damage arising from nuclear sources or from medicinal products. The exclusion of insurance against damage arising from medicinal products shall be examined by the Council within five years of the notification of this Directive. 2. This Directive shall apply to risks referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 which by reason of their nature or size call for the participation of several insured for their coverage. Any difficulties which may arise in implementing this principle shall be examined pursuant to Article 8. (1)OJ No C 60, 13.3.1975, p. 16. (2)OJ No C 47, 27.2.1975, p. 40. (3)OJ No C 32, 12.2.1976, p. 2. (4)OJ No L 228, 16.8.1973, p. 3. Article 2 1. This Directive shall apply only to those Community co-insurance operations which satisfy the following conditions: (a) the risk, within the meaning of Article 1 (1), is covered by a single contract at an overall premium and for the same period by two or more insurance undertakings, hereinafter referred to as ""co-insurers"", each for its own part ; one of these undertakings shall be the leading insurer; (b) the risk is situated within the Community; (c) for the purpose of covering this risk, the leading insurer is authorized in accordance with the conditions laid down in the First Coordination Directive, i.e. he is treated as if he were the insurer covering the whole risk; (d) at least one of the co-insurers participates in the contract by means of a head office, agency or branch established in a Member State other than that of the leading insurer; (e) the leading insurer fully assumes the leader's role in co-insurance practice and in particular determines the terms and conditions of insurance and rating. 2. Those co-insurance operations which do not satisfy the conditions set out in paragraph 1 or which cover risks other than those specified in Article 1 shall remain subject to the national laws operative at the time when this Directive comes into force. Article 3 The right of undertakings which have their head office in a Member State and which are subject to and satisfy the requirements of the First Coordination Directive to participate in Community co-insurance may not be made subject to any provisions other than those of this Directive. TITLE II Conditions and procedures for Community co-insurance Article 4 1. The amount of the technical reserves shall be determined by the different co-insurers according to the rules fixed by the Member State where they are established or, in the absence of such rules, according to customary practice in that State. However, the reserve for outstanding claims shall be at least equal to that determined by the leading insurer according to the rules or practice of the State where such insurer is established. 2. The technical reserves established by the different co-insurers shall be represented by matching assets. However, relaxation of the matching assets rule may be granted by the Member States in which the co-insurers are established in order to take account of the requirements of sound management of insurance undertakings. Such assets shall be localized either in the Member States in which the co-insurers are established or in the Member State in which the leading insurer is established, whichever the insurer chooses. Article 5 The Member States shall ensure that co-insurers established in their territory keep statistical data showing the extent of Community co-insurance operations and the countries concerned. Article 6 The supervisory authorities of the Member States shall cooperate closely in the implementation of this Directive and shall provide each other with all the information necessary to this end. Article 7 In the event of an insurance undertaking being wound up, liabilities arising from participation in Community co-insurance contracts shall be met in the same way as those arising under that undertaking's other insurance contracts without distinction as to the nationality of the insured and of the beneficiaries. TITLE III Final provisions Article 8 The Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States shall cooperate closely for the purposes of examining any difficulties which might arise in implementing this Directive. In the course of this cooperation they shall examine in particular any practices which might indicate that the purpose of the provisions of this Directive and in particular of Article 1 (2) and Article 2 are being misused either in that the leading insurer does not assume the leader's role in co-insurance practice or that the risks clearly do not require the participation of two or more insurers for their coverage. Article 9 The Commission shall submit to the Council within six years of the notification of this Directive a report on the development of Community co-insurance. Article 10 Member States shall amend their national provisions so as to comply with this Directive within 18 months of its notification and shall immediately inform the Commission thereof. The provisions thereby amended shall be applied within 24 months of such notification. Article 11 Upon notification of this Directive Member States shall ensure that the texts of the main provisions of laws, regulations or administrative measures which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive are communicated to the Commission.

Paragraph 1 shall not oblige a Member State whose legislation or administrative practice lays down, for domestic purposes, narrower limits than those contained in the provisions of that paragraph, to provide information if the State concerned does not undertake to respect those narrower limits. 3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the Member State providing the information may permit it to be used for other purposes in the requesting State, if, under the legislation of the informing State, the information could, in similar circumstances, be used in the informing State for similar purposes. 4. Where a competent authority of a Member State considers that information which it has received from the competent authority of another Member State is likely to be useful to the competent authority of a third Member State, it may transmit it to the latter competent authority with the agreement of the competent authority which supplied the information.

(a) Credit institutions existing in the same Member State at the time of the notification of this Directive and permanently affiliated at that time to a central body which supervises them and which is established in that same Member State, may be exempted from the requirements listed in the first, second and third indents of the first subparagraph of Article 3 (2), the second subparagraph of Article 3 (2), Article 3 (4) and Article 6, if, no later than the date when the national authorities take the measures necessary to translate this Directive into national law, that law provides that: - the commitments of the central body and affiliated institutions are joint and several liabilities or the commitments of its affiliated institutions are entirely guaranteed by the central body, - the solvency and liquidity of the central body and of all the affiliated institutions are monitored as a whole on the basis of consolidated accounts, - the management of the central body is empowered to issue instructions to the management of the affiliated institutions. (b) Credit institutions operating locally which are affiliated, subsequent to notification of this Directive, to a central body within the meaning of subparagraph (a) may benefit from the conditions laid down in subparagraph (a) if they constitute normal additions to the network belonging to that central body. (c) In the case of credit institutions other than those which are set up in areas newly reclaimed from the sea or have resulted from scission or mergers of existing institutions dependent or answerable to the central body, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, which shall, for this purpose, consult the Advisory Committee, may lay down additional rules for the application of subparagraph (b) including the repeal of exemptions provided for in subparagraph (a), where it is of the opinion that the affiliation of new institutions benefiting from the arrangements laid down in subparagraph (b) might have an adverse effect on competition. The Council shall decide by a qualified majority. 5. Member States may defer in whole or in part the application of this Directive to certain types or groups of credit institutions where such immediate application would cause technical problems which cannot be overcome in the short-term. The problems may result either from the fact that these institutions are subject to supervision by an authority different from that normally responsible for the supervision of banks, or from the fact that they are subject to a special system of supervision. In any event, such deferment cannot be justified by the public law statutes, by the smallness of size or by the limited scope of activity of the particular institutions concerned. Deferment can apply only to groups or types of institutions already existing at the time of notification of this Directive. 6. Pursuant to paragraph 5, a Member State may decide to defer application of this Directive for a maximum period of five years from the notification thereof and, after consulting the Advisory Committee may extend deferment once only for a maximum period of three years. The Member State shall inform the Commission of its decision and the reasons therefor not later than six months following the notification of this Directive. It shall also notify the Commission of any extension or repeal of this decision. The Commission shall publish any decision regarding deferment in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Not later than seven years following the notification of this Directive, the Commission shall, after consulting the Advisory Committee, submit a report to the Council on the situation regarding deferment. Where appropriate, the Commission shall submit to the Council, not later than six months following the submission of its report, proposals for either the inclusion of the institutions in question in the list in paragraph 2 or for the authorization of a further extension of deferment. The Council shall act on these proposals not later than six months after their submission. TITLE II Credit institutions having their head office in a Member State and their branches in other Member States Article 3 1. Member States shall require credit institutions subject to this Directive to obtain authorization before commencing their activities. They shall lay down the requirements for such authorization subject to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 and notify them to both the Commission and the Advisory Committee. 2. Without prejudice to other conditions of general application laid down by national laws, the competent authorities shall grant authorization only when the following conditions are complied with: - the credit institution must possess separate own funds, - the credit institution must possess adequate minimum own funds, - there shall be at least two persons who effectively direct the business of the credit institution. Moreover, the authorities concerned shall not grant authorization if the persons referred to in the third indent of the first subparagraph are not of sufficiently good repute or lack sufficient experience to perform such duties. 3. (a) The provisions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 may not require the application for authorization to be examined in terms of the economic needs of the market. (b) Where the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of a Member State provide, at the time of notification of the present Directive, that the economic needs of the market shall be a condition of authorization and where technical or structural difficulties in its banking system do not allow it to give up the criterion within the period laid down in Article 14 (1), the State in question may continue to apply the criterion for a period of seven years from notification. It shall notify its decision and the reasons therefor to the Commission within six months of notification. (c) Within six years of the notification of this Directive the Commission shall submit to the Council, after consulting the Advisory Committee, a report on the application of the criterion of economic need. If appropriate, the Commission shall submit to the Council proposals to terminate the application of that criterion. The period referred to in subparagraph (b) shall be extended for one further period of five years, unless, in the meantime, the Council, acting unanimously on proposals from the Commission, adopts a Decision to terminate the application of that criterion. (d) The criterion of economic need shall be applied only on the basis of general predetermined criteria, published and notified to both the Commission and the Advisory Committee and aimed at promoting: - security of savings, - higher productivity in the banking system - greater uniformity of competition between the various banking networks, - a broader range of banking services in relation to population and economic activity. Specification of the above objectives shall be determined within the Advisory Committee, which shall begin its work as from its initial meetings. 4. Member States shall also require applications for authorization to be accompanied by a programme of operations setting out inter alia the types of business envisaged and the structural organization of the institution. 5. The Advisory Committee shall examine the content given by the competent authorities to requirements listed in paragraph 2, any other requirements which the Member States apply and the information which must be included in the programme of operations, and shall, where appropriate, make suggestions to the Commission with a view to a more detailed coordination. 6. Reasons shall be given whenever an authorization is refused and the applicant shall be notified thereof within six months of receipt of the application or, should the latter be incomplete, within six months of the applicant's sending the information required for the decision. A decision shall, in any case, be taken within 12 months of the receipt of the application. 7. Every authorization shall be notified to the Commission. Each credit institution shall be entered in a list which the Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities and shall keep up to date. Article 4 1. Member States may make the commencement of business in their territory by branches of credit institutions covered by this Directive which have their head office in another Member State subject to authorization according to the law and procedure applicable to credit institutions established on their territory. 2. However, authorization may not be refused to a branch of a credit institution on the sole ground that it is established in another Member State in a legal form which is not allowed in the case of a credit institution carrying out similar activities in the host country. This provision shall not apply, however, to credit institutions which possess no separate own funds. 3. The competent authorities shall inform the Commission of any authorizations which they grant to the branches referred to in paragraph 1. 4. This Article shall not affect the rules applied by Member States to branches set up on their territory by credit institutions which have their head office there. Notwithstanding the second part of the third indent of Article 1, the laws of Member States requiring a separate authorization for each branch of a credit institution having its head office in their territory shall apply equally to the branches of credit institutions the head offices of which are in other Member States. Article 5 For the purpose of exercising their activities, credit institutions to which this Directive applies may, notwithstanding any provisions concerning the use of the words ""bank"", ""saving bank"" or other banking names which may exist in the host Member State, use throughout the territory of the Community the same name as they use in the Member States in which their head office is situated. In the event of there being any danger of confusion, the host Member State may, for the purposes of clarification, require that the name be accompanied by certain explanatory particulars. Article 6 1. Pending subsequent coordination, the competent authorities shall, for the purposes of observation and, if necessary, in addition to such coefficients as may be applied by them, establish ratios between the various assets and/or liabilities of credit institutions with a view to monitoring their solvency and liquidity and the other measures which may serve to ensure that savings are protected. To this end, the Advisory Committee shall decide on the content of the various factors of the observation ratios referred to in the first subparagraph and lay down the method to be applied in calculating them. Where appropriate, the Advisory Committee shall be guided by technical consultations between the supervisory authorities of the categories of institutions concerned. 2. The observation ratios established in pursuance of paragraph 1 shall be calculated at least every six months. 3. The Advisory Committee shall examine the results of analyses carried out by the supervisory authorities referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 1 on the basis of the calculations referred to in paragraph 2. 4. The Advisory Committee may make suggestions to the Commission with a view to coordinating the coefficients applicable in the Member States. Article 7 1. The competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall collaborate closely in order to supervise the activities of credit institutions operating, in particular by having established branches there, in one or more Member States other than that in which their head offices are situated. They shall supply one another with all information concerning the management and ownership of such credit institutions that is likely to facilitate their supervision and the examination of the conditions for their authorization and all information likely to facilitate the monitoring of their liquidity and solvency. 2. The competent authorities may also, for the purposes and within the meaning of Article 6, lay down ratios applicable to the branches referred to in this Article by reference to the factors laid down in Article 6. 3. The Advisory Committee shall take account of the adjustments necessitated by the specific situation of the branches in relation to national regulations. Article 8 1. The competent authorities may withdraw the authorization issued to a credit institution subject to this Directive or to a branch authorized under Article 4 only where such an institution or branch: (a) does not make use of the authorization within 12 months, expressly renounces the authorization or has ceased to engage in business for more than six months, if the Member State concerned has made no provision for the authorization to lapse in such cases; (b) has obtained the authorization through false statements or any other irregular means; (c) no longer fulfils the conditions under which authorization was granted, with the exception of those in respect of own funds; (d) no longer possesses sufficient own funds or can no longer be relied upon to fulfil its obligations towards its creditors, and in particular no longer provides security for the assets entrusted to it; (e) falls within one of the other cases where national law provides for withdrawal of authorization. 2. In addition, the authorization issued to a branch under Article 4 shall be withdrawn if the competent authority of the country in which the credit institution which established the branch has its head office has withdrawn authorization from that institution. 3. Member States which grant the authorizations referred to in Articles 3 (1) and 4 (1) only if, economically, the market situation requires it may not invoke the disappearance of such a need as grounds for withdrawing such authorizations. 4. Before withdrawal from a branch of an authorization granted under Article 4, the competent authority of the Member State in which its head office is situated shall be consulted. Where immediate action is called for, notification may take the place of such consultation. The same procedure shall be followed, by analogy, in cases of withdrawal of authorization from a credit institution which has branches in other Member States. 5. Reasons must be given for any withdrawal of authorization and those concerned informed thereof ; such withdrawal shall be notified to the Commission. TITLE III Branches of credit institutions having their head offices outside the Community Article 9 1. Member States shall not apply to branches of credit institutions having their head office outside the Community, when commencing or carrying on their business, provisions which result in more favourable treatment than that accorded to branches of credit institutions having their head office in the Community. 2. The competent authorities shall notify the Commission and the Advisory Committee of all authorizations for branches granted to credit institutions having their head office outside the Community. 3. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the Community may, through agreements concluded in accordance with the Treaty with one or more third countries, agree to apply provisions which, on the basis of the principle of reciprocity, accord to branches of a credit institution having its head office outside the Community identical treatment throughout the territory of the Community. TITLE IV General and transitional provisions Article 10 1. Credit institutions subject to this Directive, which took up their business in accordance with the provisions of the Member States in which they have their head offices before the entry into force of the provisions implementing this Directive shall be deemed to be authorized. They shall be subject to the provisions of this Directive concerning the carrying on of the business of credit institutions and to the requirements set out in the first and third indents of the first subparagraph and in the second subparagraph of Article 3 (2). Member States may allow credit institutions which at the time of notification of this Directive do not comply with the requirement laid down in the third indent of the first subparagraph of Article 3 (2), no more than five years in which to do so. Member States may decide that undertakings which do not fulfil the requirements set out in the first indent of the first subparagraph of Article 3 (2) and which are in existence at the time this Directive enters into force may continue to carry on their business. They may exempt such undertakings from complying with the requirement contained in the third indent of the first subparagraph of Article 3 (2). 2. All the credit institutions referred to in paragraph 1 shall be given in the list referred to in Article 3 (7). 3. If a credit institution deemed to be authorized under paragraph 1 has not undergone any authorization procedure prior to commencing business, a prohibition on the carrying on of its business shall take the place of withdrawal of authorization. Subject to the first subparagraph, Article 8 shall apply by analogy. 4. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, credit institutions established in a Member State without having undergone an authorization procedure in that Member State prior to commencing business may be required to obtain authorization from the competent authorities of the Member State concerned in accordance with the provisions implementing this Directive. Such institutions may be required to comply with the requirement in the second indent of Article 3 (2) and with such other conditions of general application as may be laid down by the Member State concerned. Article 11 1. An ""Advisory Committee of the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Community"" shall be set up alongside the Commission. 2. The tasks of the Advisory Committee shall be to assist the Commission in ensuring the proper implementation of both this Directive and Council Directive 73/183/EEC of 28 June 1973 on the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of self-employed activities of banks and other financial institutions (1) in so far as it relates to credit institutions. Further it shall carry out the other tasks prescribed by this Directive and shall assist the Commission in the preparation of new proposals to the Council concerning further coordination in the sphere of credit institutions. 3. The Advisory Committee shall not concern itself with concrete problems relating to individual credit institutions. 4. The Advisory Committee shall be composed of not more than three representatives from each Member State and from the Commission. These representatives may be accompanied by advisers from time and subject to the prior agreement of the Committee. The Committee may also invite qualified persons and experts to participate in its meetings. The secretariat shall be provided by the Commission. 5. The first meeting of the Advisory Committee shall be convened by the Commission under the chairmanship of one of its representatives. The Advisory Committee shall then adopt its rules of procedure and shall elect a chairman from among the representatives of Member States. Thereafter it shall meet at regular intervals and whenever the situation demands. The Commission may ask the Committee to hold an emergency meeting if it considers that the situation so requires. 6. The Advisory Committee's discussions and the outcome thereof shall be confidential except when the Committee decides otherwise. Article 12 1. Member States shall ensure that all persons now or in the past employed by the competent authorities are bound by the obligation of professional secrecy. This means that any confidential information which they may receive in the course of their duties may not be divulged to any person or authority except by virtue of provisions laid down by law. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not, however, preclude communications between the competent authorities of the various Member States, as provided for in this Directive. Information thus exchanged shall be covered by the obligation of professional secrecy applying to the persons now or in the past employed by the competent authorities receiving the information. 3. Without prejudice to cases covered by criminal law, the authorities receiving such information shall use it only to examine the conditions for the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions, to facilitate monitoring of the liquidity and solvency of these institutions or when the decisions of the competent authority are the subject of an administrative appeal or in court proceedings initiated pursuant to Article 13. Article 13 Member States shall ensure that decisions taken in respect of a credit institution in pursuance of laws, regulations and administrative provisions adopted in accordance with this Directive may be subject to the right to apply to the courts. The same shall apply (1)OJ No L 194, 16.7.1973, p. 1. where no decision is taken within six months of its submission in respect of an application for authorization which contains all the information required under the provisions in force. TITLE V Final provisions Article 14 1. Member States shall bring into force the measures necessary to comply with this Directive within 24 months of its notification and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 2. As from the notification of this Directive, Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main laws, regulations and administrative provisions which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.

Host Member States may require this title to be followed by the name and location of the establishment or examining board which awarded it. 2. If the academic title used in the Member State of origin, or in the Member State from which a foreign national comes, can be confused in the host Member State with a title requiring, in that State, additional training which the person concerned has not undergone, the host Member State may require such a person to use the title employed in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which he comes, in suitable wording to be indicated by the host Member State. CHAPTER V PROVISIONS TO FACILITATE THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF ESTABLISHMENT AND FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN RESPECT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF NURSES RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERAL CARE A. Provisions specifically relating to the right of establishment Article 6 1. A host Member State which requires of its nationals proof of good character or good repute when they take up for the first time any activity referred to in Article 1 shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of other Member States, a certificate issued by a competent authority in the Member State of origin or in the Member State from which the foreign national comes attesting that the requirements of the Member State as to good character or good repute for taking up the activity in question have been met. 2. Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not require proof of good character or good repute of persons wishing to take up the activity in question for the first time, the host Member State may require of nationals of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes an extract from the ""judicial record"" or, failing this, an equivalent document issued by a competent authority in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes. 3. If the host Member State has detailed knowledge of a serious matter which has occurred outside its territory and which is likely to affect the taking up within its territory of the activity concerned, it may inform the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes. The Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes shall verify the accuracy of the facts if they are likely to affect in that Member State the taking up of the activity in question. The authorities in that State shall decide on the nature and extent of the investigation to be made and shall inform the host Member State of any consequential action which they take with regard to the certificates or documents they have issued. Member States shall ensure the confidentiality of the information which is forwarded. Article 7 1.

Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not impose any requirements of this nature on those wishing to take up or pursue the activity in question, the host Member State shall accept from such national a certificate issued by a competent authority in that State corresponding to the certificates issued in the host Member State. Article 9 Documents issued in accordance with Articles 6, 7 and 8 may not be presented more than three months after their date of issue. Article 10 1. The procedure for authorizing the person concerned to take up any activity referred to in Article 1, pursuant to Articles 6, 7 and 8, must be completed as soon as possible and not later than three months after presentation of all the documents relating to such person, without prejudice to delays resulting from any appeal that may be made upon the termination of this procedure. 2. In the cases referred to in Articles 6 (3) and 7 (2), a request for re-examination shall suspend the period stipulated in paragraph 1. The Member State consulted shall give its reply within three months. On receipt of the reply or at the end of the period the host Member State shall continue with the procedure referred to in paragraph 1. B. Special provisions relating to the provision of services Article 11 1. Where a Member State requires of its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue any of the activities referred to in Article 1 an authorization, or membership of or registration with a professional organization or body, that Member State shall in the case of the provision of services exempt the nationals of Member States from that requirement. The person concerned shall provide services with the same rights and obligations as the nationals of the host Member State ; in particular he shall be subject to the rules of conduct of a professional or administrative nature which apply in that Member State. Where a host Member State adopts a measure pursuant to the second subparagraph or becomes aware of facts which run counter to these provisions, it shall forthwith inform the Member State where the person concerned is established. 2. The host Member State may require the person concerned to make a prior declaration to the competent authorities concerning the provision of his services where they involve a temporary stay in its territory. In urgent cases this declaration may be made as soon as possible after the services have been provided. 3. Pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2, the host Member State may require the person concerned to supply one or more documents containing the following particulars: - the declaration referred to in paragraph 2, - a certificate stating that the person concerned is lawfully pursuing the activities in question in the Member State where he is established, - a certificate that the person concerned holds one or other of the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualification appropriate for the provision of the services in question and referred to in this Directive. 4.

Article 12 Where registration with a public social security body is required in a host Member State for the settlement with insurance bodies of accounts relating to services rendered to persons insured under social security schemes, that Member State shall exempt nationals of Member States established in another Member State from this requirement in cases of provision of services entailing travel on the part of the person concerned. However, the persons concerned shall supply information to this body in advance or, in urgent cases, subsequently, concerning the services provided. C. Provisions common to the right of establishment and freedom to provide services Article 13 Where in a host Member State the use of the professional title relating to one of the activities referred to in Article 1 is subject to rules, nationals of other Member States who fulfil the conditions laid down in Articles 2 and 4 shall use the professional title of the host Member State which, in that State, corresponds to those conditions of qualification, and shall use the abbreviated title. Article 14 Where a host Member State requires its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue one of the activities referred to in Article 1 to take an oath or make a solemn declaration and where the form of such oath or declaration cannot be used by nationals of other Member States, that Member State shall ensure that an appropriate and equivalent form of oath or declaration is offered to the person concerned. Article 15 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to enable the persons concerned to obtain information on the health and social security laws and, where applicable, on the professional ethics of the host Member State. For this purpose, Member States may set up information centres from which such persons may obtain the necessary information. In the case of establishment, the host Member States may require the persons concerned to contact these centres. 2. Member States may set up the centres referred to in paragraph 1 within the competent authorities and bodies which they must designate within the period laid down in Article 19 (1). 3. Member States shall see to it that, where appropriate, the persons concerned acquire, in their own interest and in that of their patients, the linguistic knowledge necessary for the exercise of their profession in the host Member State.

"50","31977L0388","TITLE I INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS Article 1 Member States shall modify their present value added tax systems in accordance with the following Articles. They shall adopt the necessary laws, regulations and administrative provisions so that the systems as modified enter into force at the earliest opportunity and by 1 January 1978 at the latest. TITLE II SCOPE Article 2 The following shall be subject to value added tax: 1. the supply of goods or services effected for consideration within the territory of the country by a taxable person acting as such; 2. the importation of goods. TITLE III TERRITORIAL APPLICATION Article 3 1. For the purposes of this Directive, the ""territory of the country"" shall be the area of application of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community as stipulated in respect of each Member State in Article 227. 2. The following territories of individual Member States shall be excluded from the ""territory of the country"": Federal Republic of Germany : the Island of Heligoland, the territory of BÃ ¼singen; Kingdom of Denmark : Greenland; Republic of Italy Livigno, Campione d'Italia, the Italian waters of Lake Lugano. 3. If the Commission considers that the exclusions provided for in paragraph 2 are no longer justified, particularly in terms of fair competition or own resources, it shall submit appropriate proposals to the Council. TITLE IV TAXABLE PERSONS Article 4 1. ""Taxable person"" shall mean any person who independently carries out in any place any economic activity specified in paragraph 2, whatever the purpose or results of that activity. 2. The economic activities referred to in paragraph 1 shall comprise all activities of producers, traders and persons supplying services including mining and agricultural activities and activities of the professions. The exploitation of tangible or intangible property for the purpose of obtaining income therefrom on a continuing basis shall also be considered an economic activity. 3. Member States may also treat as a taxable person anyone who carries out, on an occasional basis, a transaction relating to the activities referred to in paragraph 2 and in particular one of the following: (a) the supply before first occupation of buildings or parts of buildings and the land on which they stand ; Member States may determine the conditions of application of this criterion to transformations of buildings and the land on which they stand. Member States may apply criteria other than that of first occupation, such as the period elapsing between the date of completion of the building and the date of first supply or the period elapsing between the date of first occupation and the date of subsequent supply, provided that these periods do not exceed five years and two years respectively. ""A building"" shall be taken to mean any structure fixed to or in the ground; (b) the supply of building land. ""Building land"" shall mean any unimproved or improved land defined as such by the Member States. 4. The use of the word ""independently"" in paragraph 1 shall exclude employed and other persons from the tax in so far as they are bound to an employer by a contract of employment or by any other legal ties creating the relationship of employer and employee as regards working conditions, remuneration and the employer's liability. Subject to the consultations provided for in Article 29, each Member State may treat as a single taxable person persons established in the territory of the country who, while legally independent, are closely bound to one another by financial, economic and organizational links. 5. States, regional and local government authorities and other bodies governed by public law shall not be considered taxable persons in respect of the activities or transactions in which they engage as public authorities, even where they collect dues, fees, contributions or payments in connection with these activities or transactions. However, when they engage in such activities or transactions, they shall be considered taxable persons in respect of these activities or transactions where treatment as non-taxable persons would lead to significant distortions of competition. In any case, these bodies shall be considered taxable persons in relation to the activities listed in Annex D, provided they are not carried out on such a small scale as to be negligible. Member States may consider activities of these bodies which are exempt under Article 13 or 28 as activities which they engage in as public authorities. TITLE V TAXABLE TRANSACTIONS Article 5 Supply of goods 1. ""Supply of goods"" shall mean the transfer of the right to dispose of tangible property as owner. 2. Electric current, gas, heat, refrigeration and the like shall be considered tangible property. 3. Member States may consider the following to be tangible property: (a) certain interest in immovable property; (b) rights in rem giving the holder thereof a right of user over immovable property; (c) shares or interests equivalent to shares giving the holder thereof de jure or de facto rights of ownership or possession over immovable property or part thereof. 4. The following shall also be considered supplies within the meaning of paragraph 1: (a) the transfer, by order made by or in the name of a public authority or in pursuance of the law, of the ownership of property against payment of compensation; (b) the actual handing over of goods, pursuant to a contract for the hire of goods for a certain period or for the sale of goods on deferred terms, which provides that in the normal course of events ownership shall pass at the latest upon payment of the final instalment; (c) the transfer of goods pursuant to a contract under which commission is payable on purchase or sale. 5. Member States may consider the following to be supplies within the meaning of paragraph 1: (a) supplies under a contract to make up work from customer's materials, that is to say delivery by a contractor to his customer of movable property made or assembled by the contractor from materials or objects entrusted to him by the customer for this purpose, whether or not the contractor has provided any part of the materials used; (b) the handing over of certain works of construction. 6. The application by a taxable person of goods forming part of his business assets for his private use or that of his staff, or the disposal thereof free of charge or more generally their application for purposes other than those of his business, where the value added tax on the goods in question or the component parts thereof was wholly or partly deductible, shall be treated as supplies made for consideration. However, applications for the giving of samples or the making of gifts of small value for the purposes of the taxable person's business shall not be so treated. 7. Member States may treat as supplies made for consideration: (a) the application by a taxable person for the purposes of his business of goods produced, constructed, extracted, processed, purchased or imported in the course of such business, where the value added tax on such goods, had they been acquired from another taxable person, would not be wholly deductible; (b) the application of goods by a taxable person for the purposes of a non-taxable transaction, where the value added tax on such goods became wholly or partly deductible upon their acquisition or upon their application in accordance with subparagraph (a); (c) except in those cases mentioned in paragraph 8, the retention of goods by a taxable person or his successors when he ceases to carry out a taxable economic activity where the value added tax on such goods became wholly or partly deductible upon their acquisition or upon their application in accordance with subparagraph (a). 8. In the event of a transfer, whether for consideration or not or as a contribution to a company, of a totality of assets or part thereof, Member States may consider that no supply of goods has taken place and in that event the recipient shall be treated as the successor to the transferor. Where appropriate, Member States may take the necessary measures to prevent distortion of competition in cases where the recipient is not wholly liable to tax. Article 6 Supply of services 1. ""Supply of services"" shall mean any transaction which does not constitute a supply of goods within the meaning of Article 5. Such transactions may include inter alia: - assignments of intangible property whether or not it is the subject of a document establishing title, - obligations to refrain from an act or to tolerate an act or situation, - the performances of services in pursuance of an order made by or in the name of a public authority or in pursuance of the law. 2. The following shall be treated as supplies of services for consideration: (a) the use of goods forming part of the assets of a business for the private use of the taxable person or of his staff or more generally for purposes other than those of his business where the value added tax on such goods is wholly or partly deductible; (b) supplies of services carried out free of charge by the taxable person for his own private use or that of his staff or more generally for purposes other than those of his business. Member States may derogate from the provisions of this paragraph provided that such derogation does not lead to distortion of competition. 3. In order to prevent distortion of competition and subject to the consultations provided for in Article 29, Member States may treat as a supply of services for consideration the supply by a taxable person of a service for the purposes of his undertaking where the value added tax on such a service, had it been supplied by another taxable person, would not be wholly deductible. 4. Where a taxable person acting in his own name but on behalf of another takes part in a supply of services, he shall be considered to have received and supplied those services himself. 5. Article 5 (8) shall apply in like manner to the supply of services. Article 7 Imports ""Importation of goods"" shall mean the entry of goods into the territory of the country as defined in Article 3. TITLE VI PLACE OF TAXABLE TRANSACTIONS Article 8 Supply of goods 1. The place of supply of goods shall be deemed to be: (a) in the case of goods dispatched or transported either by the supplier or by the person to whom they are supplied or by a third person : the place where the goods are at the time when dispatch or transport to the person to whom they are supplied begins. Where the goods are installed or assembled, with or without a trial run, by or on behalf of the supplier, the place of supply shall be deemed to be the place where the goods are installed or assembled. In cases where the installation or assembly is carried out in a country other than that of the supplier, the Member State into which the goods are imported shall take any necessary steps to avoid double taxation in that State; (b) in the case of goods not dispatched or transported : the place where the goods are when the supply takes place. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 (a), where the place of departure of the consignment or transport of goods is in a country other than the country of import of those goods, the place of the supply by the importer within the meaning of Article 21 (2) and the place of any subsequent supplies shall be deemed to be within the country of import of the goods. Article 9 Supply of services 1. The place where a service is supplied shall be deemed to be the place where the supplier has established his business or has a fixed establishment from which the service is supplied or, in the absence of such a place of business or fixed establishment, the place where he has his permanent address or usually resides. 2. However: (a) the place of the supply of services connected with immovable property, including the services of estate agents and experts, and of services for preparing and coordinating construction works, such as the services of architects and of firms providing on-site supervision, shall be the place where the property is situated; (b) the place where transport services are supplied shall be the place where transport takes place, having regard to the distances covered; (c) the place of the supply of services relating to: - cultural, artistic, sporting, scientific, educational, entertainment or similar activities, including the activities of the organizers of such activities, and where appropriate, the supply of ancillary services, - ancillary transport activities such as loading, unloading, handling and similar activities, - valuations of movable tangible property, - work on movable tangible property, shall be the place where those services are physically carried out; (d) in the case of hiring out of movable tangible property, with the exception of all forms of transport, which is exported by the lessor from one Member State with a view to its being used in another Member State, the place of supply of the service shall be the place of utilization; (e) the place where the following services are supplied when performed for customers established outside the Community or for taxable persons established in the Community but not in the same country as the supplier, shall be the place where the customer has established his business or has a fixed establishment to which the service is supplied or, in the absence of such a place, the place where he has his permanent address or usually resides: - transfers and assignments of copyrights, patents, licences, trade marks and similar rights, - advertising services, - services of consultants, engineers, consultancy bureaux, lawyers, accountants and other similar services, as well as data processing and the supplying of information, - obligations to refrain from pursuing or exercising, in whole or in part, a business activity or a right referred to in this point (e), - banking, financial and insurance transactions including reinsurance, with the exception of the hire of safes, - the supply of staff, - the services of agents who act in the name and for the account of another, when they procure for their principal the services referred to in this point (e). 3. In order to avoid double taxation, non-taxation or the distortion of competition the Member States may, with regard to the supply of services referred to in 2 (e) and the hiring out of movable tangible property consider: (a) the place of supply of services, which under this Article would be situated within the territory of the country, as being situated outside the Community where the effective use and enjoyment of the services take place outside the Community; (b) the place of supply of services, which under this Article would be situated outside the Community, as being within the territory of the country where the effective use and enjoyment of the services take place within the territory of the country. TITLE VII CHARGEABLE EVENT AND CHARGEABILITY OF TAX Article 10 1. (a) ""Chargeable event"" shall mean the occurrence by virtue of which the legal conditions necessary for tax to become chargeable are fulfilled. (b) The tax becomes ""chargeable"" when the tax authority becomes entitled under the law at a given moment to claim the tax from the person liable to pay, notwithstanding that the time of payment may be deferred. 2. The chargeable event shall occur and the tax shall become chargeable when the goods are delivered or the services are performed. Deliveries of goods other than those referred to in Article 5 (4) (b) and supplies of services which give rise to successive statements of account or payments shall be regarded as being completed at the time when the periods to which such statements of account or payments pertain expire. However, where a payment is to be made on account before the goods are delivered or the services are performed, the tax shall become chargeable on receipt of the payment and on the amount received. By way of derogation from the above provisions, Member States may provide that the tax shall become chargeable, for certain transactions or for certain categories of taxable person, either: - no later than the issue of the invoice or of the document serving as invoice, or - no later than receipt of the price, or - where an invoice or document serving as invoice is not issued, or is issued late, within a specified period from the date of the chargeable event. 3. As regards imported goods, the chargeable event shall occur and the tax shall become chargeable at the time when goods enter the territory of the country as defined in Article 3. Where imported goods are subject to customs duties, to agricultural levies or to charges having equivalent effect established under a common policy, Member States may link the chargeable event and the date when the tax becomes chargeable with those laid down for these Community duties. In cases where imported goods are not subject to any of these Community duties, Member States may apply the provisions in force governing customs duties as regards the chargeable event and the date when the tax becomes chargeable. Where goods are placed on importation under one of the arrangements provided for in Article 16 (1) A or under arrangements for transit or temporary admission, the chargeable event and the date when the tax becomes chargeable shall occur only when the goods cease to be covered by these arrangements and are declared for home use. TITLE VIII TAXABLE AMOUNT Article 11 A. Within the territory of the country 1. The taxable amount shall be: (a) in respect of supplies of goods and services other than those referred to in (b), (c) and (d) below, everything which constitutes the consideration which has been or is to be obtained by the supplier from the purchaser, the customer or a third party for such supplies including subsidies directly linked to the price of such supplies; (b) in respect of supplies referred to in Article 5 (6) and (7), the purchase price of the goods or of similar goods or, in the absence of a purchase price, the cost price, determined as the time of supply; (c) in respect of supplies referred to in Article 6 (2), the full cost to the taxable person of providing the services; (d) in respect of supplies referred to in Article 6 (3), the open market value of the services supplied. ""Open market value"" of services shall mean the amount which a customer at the marketing stage at which the supply takes place would have to pay to a supplier at arm's length within the territory of the country at the time of the supply under conditions of fair competition to obtain the services in question. 2. The taxable amount shall include: (a) taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the value added tax itself; (b) incidental expenses such as commission, packing, transport and insurance costs charged by the supplier to the purchaser or customer. Expenses covered by a separate agreement may be considered to be incidental expenses by the Member States. 3. The taxable amount shall not include: (a) price reductions by way of discount for early payment; (b) price discounts and rebates allowed to the customer and accounted for at the time of the supply; (c) the amounts received by a taxable person from his purchaser or customer as repayment for expenses paid out in the name and for the account of the latter and which are entered in his books in a suspense account. The taxable person must furnish proof of the actual amount of this expenditure and may not deduct any tax which may have been charged on these transactions. B. Importation of goods 1.The taxable amount shall be: (a) the price paid or to be paid by the importer, where this price is the sole consideration defined in A (1) (a); (b) the open market value, where no price is paid or where the price paid or to be paid is not the sole consideration for the imported goods. ""Open market value"" of imported goods shall mean the amount which an importer at the marketing stage at which the importation takes place would have to pay to a supplier at arm's length in the country from which the goods are exported at the time when the tax becomes chargeable under conditions of fair competition to obtain the goods in question. 2.Member States may adopt as taxable amount the value defined in Regulation (EEC) No 803/68 (1). (1)OJ No L 148, 28.6.1968, p. 6. 3.The taxable amount shall include, in so far as they are not already included: (a) taxes, duties, levies and other charges due outside the country of importation and those due by reason of importation, excluding the value added tax to be levied; (b) incidental expenses, such as commission, packing, transport and insurance costs, incurred up to the first place of destination within the territory of the country. ""First place of destination"" shall mean the place mentioned on the consignment note or any other transport document by means of which the goods are imported into the country of importation. In the absence of such an indication, the first place of destination shall be taken to be the place of the first transfer of cargo in that country. Equally, the Member States may include in the taxable amount the incidental expenses referred to above where they result from transport to another place of destination, if the latter is known at the time when the chargeable event occurs. 4.The taxable amount shall not include those factors referred to in A (3) (a) and (b). 5.When goods have been temporarily exported and are re-imported after having undergone abroad repair, processing or adaptation, or after having been made up or reworked abroad, and the re-importation is not exempt under the provisions of Article 14 (1) (f), Member States shall take steps to ensure that the treatment of the goods for value added tax purposes is the same as that which would have applied to the goods in question had the above operations been carried out within the territory of the country. C. Miscellaneous provisions 1.In the case of cancellation, refusal or total or partial non-payment, or where the price is reduced after the supply takes place, the taxable amount shall be reduced accordingly under conditions which shall be determined by the Member States. However, in the case of total or partial non-payment, Member States may derogate from this rule. 2.Where information for determining the taxable amount is expressed in a currency other than that of the Member State where assessment takes place, the exchange rate shall be determined in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 803/68. 3.As regards returnable packing costs, Member States may: - either exclude them from the taxable amount and take the necessary measures to see that this amount is adjusted if the packing is not returned, - or include them in the taxable amount and take the necessary measures to see that this amount is adjusted where the packing is in fact returned. TITLE IX RATES Article 12 1. The rate applicable to taxable transactions shall be that in force at the time of the chargeable event. However: (a) in the cases provided for in the second and third subparagraphs of Article 10 (2), the rate to be used shall be that in force when the tax becomes chargeable; (b) in the cases provided for in the second and third subparagraphs of Article 10 (3), the rate applicable shall be that in force at the time when application is made for the goods to be released for home use. 2. In the event of changes in the rates, Member States may: - effect adjustments in the cases provided for in paragraph 1 (a) in order to take account of the rate applicable at the time when the goods or services were supplied, - adopt all appropriate transitional measures. 3. The standard rate of value added tax shall be fixed by each Member State as a percentage of the taxable amount and shall be the same for the supply of goods and for the supply of services. 4. In certain cases, the supply of goods or services may be made subject to increased or reduced rates. Each reduced rate shall be so fixed that the amount of value added tax resulting from the application thereof shall be such as in the normal way to permit the deduction therefrom of the whole of the value added tax deductible under the provisions of Article 17. 5. The rate applicable on the importation of goods shall be that applied to the supply of like goods within the territory of the country.

However, Member States shall have the option of not granting exemption where this would be liable to have a serious effect on conditions of competition on the home market; (e) reimportation by the person who exported them of goods in the state in which they were exported, where they qualify for exemption from customs duties or would qualify therefor if they were imported from a third country; (f) the re-importation of movable tangible property by the person who exported it, or by another person on his account, where that property has while in another Member State undergone work which has been taxed without the right to deduction or refund; (g) importations of goods: - under diplomatic and consular arrangements, which qualify for exemption from customs duties or would qualify therefor if they were imported from a third country, - by international organizations recognized as such by the public authorities of the host country, and by members of such organizations, within the limits and under the conditions laid down by the international conventions establishing the organizations or by headquarters agreements, - into the territory of Member States which are parties to the North Atlantic Treaty by the armed forces of other States which are parties to that Treaty for the use of such forces or the civilian staff accompanying them or for supplying their messes or canteens where such forces take part in the common defence effort: (h) importation into ports by sea fishing undertakings of their catches, unprocessed or after undergoing preservation for marketing but before being supplied; (i) the supply of services, in connection with the importation of goods where the value of such services is included in the taxable amount in accordance with Article 11 B (3) (b); (j) importation of gold by Central Banks. 2. The Commission shall submit to the Council at the earliest opportunity proposals designed to lay down Community tax rules clarifying the scope of the exemptions referred to in paragraph 1 and detailed rules for their implementation. Until the entry into force of these rules, Member States may: - maintain their national provisions in force on matters related to the above provisions, - adapt their national provisions to minimize distortion of competition and in particular the non-imposition or double imposition of value added tax within the Community, - use whatever administrative procedures they consider most appropriate to achieve exemption. Member States shall inform the Commission, which shall inform the other Member States, of the measures they have adopted and are adopting pursuant to the preceding provisions. Article 15 Exemption of exports and like transactions and international transport Without prejudice to other Community provisions Member States shall exempt the following under conditions which they shall lay down for the purpose of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of such exemptions and of preventing any evasion, avoidance or abuse: 1. the supply of goods dispatched or transported to a destination outside the territory of the country as defined in Article 3 by or on behalf of the vendor; 2. the supply of goods dispatched or transported to a destination outside the territory of the country as defined in Article 3 by or on behalf of a purchaser not established within the territory of the country, with the exception of goods transported by the purchaser himself for the equipping, fuelling and provisioning of pleasure boats and private aircraft or any other means of transport for private use; 3. the supply of services consisting of work on movable property acquired or imported for the purpose of undergoing such work in the territory of the country as defined in Article 3, and dispatched or transported out of the territory of that country by the person providing the services or by his customer who is not established within the territory of the country or on behalf of either of them; 4. the supply of goods for the fuelling and provisioning of vessels: (a) used for navigation on the high seas and carrying passengers for reward or used for the purpose of commercial, industrial or fishing activities; (b) used for rescue or assistance at sea, or for inshore fishing, with the exception, for the latter, of ships' provisions; (c) of war, as defined in subheading 89.01 A of the Common Customs Tariff, leaving the country and bound for foreign ports or anchorages. The Member States may, however, restrict the scope of this exemption until the implementation of Community tax rules in this field; 5. the supply, modification, repair, maintenance, chartering and hiring of the sea-going vessels referred to in paragraph 4 (a) and (b) and the supply, hiring, repair and maintenance of equipment - including fishing equipment - incorporated or used therein; 6. the supply, modification, repair, maintenance, chartering and hiring of aircraft used by airlines operating for reward chiefly on international routes, and the supply, hiring, repair and maintenance of equipment incorporated or used therein; 7. the supply of goods for the fuelling and provisioning of aircraft referred to in paragraph 6; 8. the supply of services other than those referred to in paragraph 5, to meet the direct needs of the sea-going vessels referred to in that paragraph or of their cargoes; 9. the supply of services other than those referred to in paragraph 6, to meet the direct needs of aircraft referred to in that paragraph or of their cargoes; 10. supplies of goods and services: - under diplomatic and consular arrangements, - to international organizations recognized as such by the public authorities of the host country, and to members of such organizations, within the limits and under the conditions laid down by the international conventions establishing the organizations or by headquarters agreements, - effected within a Member State which is a party to the North Atlantic Treaty and intended either for the use of the forces of other States which are parties to that Treaty or of the civilian staff accompanying them, or for supplying their messes or canteens when such forces take part in the common defence effort. This exemption shall be subject to conditions and limitations laid down by Member States until Community tax rules are adopted. The exemption may be implemented by means of a refund of the tax; 11. supplies of gold to Central Banks; 12. goods supplied to approved bodies which export them as part of their humanitarian, charitable or teaching activities abroad. This exemption may be implemented by means of a refund of the tax; 13. the supply of services including transport and ancillary transactions but excluding the supply of services exempted under Article 13, when these are directly linked to the transit or the export of goods, or to the imports of goods benefiting from the provisions of Articles 14 (1) (b) and (c), and 16 (1); 14. services supplied by brokers and other intermediaries, acting in the name and for account of another person, where they form part of transactions specified in this Article, or of transactions carried out outside the territory of the country as defined in Article 3. This exemption does not apply to travel agents who supply in the name and for account of the traveller services which are supplied in other Member States. Article 16 Special exemptions linked to international goods traffic 1. Without prejudice to other Community provisions, Member States may, subject to the consultations provided for in Article 29, take special measures designed to relieve from value added tax all or some of the following transactions, provided that they are not aimed at final use and/or consumption and that the amount of value added tax charged at entry for home use corresponds to the amount of the tax which should have been charged had each of these transactions been taxed on import or within the territory of the country: A. importation of goods which are intended to be: (a) produced to customs and, where applicable, placed in temporary storage within the meaning of Directive 68/312/EEC (1); (b) placed under free zone arrangements such as those within the meaning of Directive 69/75/EEC (2); (c) placed under customs warehousing arrangements within the meaning of Directive 69/74/EEC (3); (d) admitted into the waters and foreshores referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1496/68 (4); (e) placed under warehousing arrangements other than customs, or inward processing arrangements; B. supplies of goods shipped or carried to places specified in A above and supplies of services related to such supplies; C. supplies of goods and services carried out in the places listed in A above and still subject to one of the arrangements specified therein; D. supplies of goods still subject to arrangements for transit or temporary importation specified in Article 14 (1) (b) and (c) as well as supplies of services related to such supplies. 2. Subject to the consultation provided for in Article 29, Member States may opt to exempt imports for and supplies of goods to a taxable person intending to export them as they are or after processing, as well as supplies of services linked with his export business, up to a maximum equal to the value of his exports during the preceding 12 months. 3. The Commission shall submit to the Council at the earliest opportunity proposals concerning common arrangements for applying value added tax to the transactions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. TITLE XI DEDUCTIONS Article 17 Origin and scope of the right to deduct 1. The right to deduct shall arise at the time when the deductible tax becomes chargeable. 2. In so far as the goods and services are used for the purposes of his taxable transactions, the taxable person shall be entitled to deduct from the tax which he is liable to pay: (a) value added tax due or paid in respect of goods or services supplied or to be supplied to him by another taxable person; (b) value added tax due or paid in respect of imported goods; (1)OJ No L 194, 6.8.1968, p. 13. (2)OJ No L 58, 8.3.1969, p. 11. (3)OJ No L 58, 8.3.1969, p. 7. (4)OJ No L 238, 28.9.1968, p. 1. (c) value added tax due under Articles 5 (7) (a) and 6 (3). 3. Member States shall also grant to every taxable person the right to a deduction or refund of the value added tax referred to in paragraph 2 in so far as the goods and services are used for the purposes of: (a) transactions relating to the economic activities as referred to in Article 4 (2) carried out in another country, which would be eligible for deduction of tax if they had occurred in the territory of the country; (b) transactions which are exempt under Article 14 (1) (i) and under Articles 15 and 16 (1) (B), (C) and (D), and paragraph 2; (c) any of the transactions exempted under Article 13 B (a) and (d), paragraphs 1 to 5, when the customer is established outside the Community or when these transactions are directly linked with goods intended to be exported to a country outside the Community. 4. The Council shall endeavour to adopt before 31 December 1977, on a proposal from the Commission and acting unanimously, Community rules laying down the arrangements under which refunds are to be made in accordance with paragraph 3 to taxable persons not established in the territory of the country. Until such Community arrangements enter into force, Member States shall themselves determine the method by which the refund concerned shall be made. Where the taxable person is not resident in the territory of the Community, Member States may refuse the refund or impose supplementary conditions. 5. As regards goods and services to be used by a taxable person both for transactions covered by paragraphs 2 and 3, in respect of which value added tax is deductible, and for transactions in respect of which value added tax is not deductible, only such proportion of the value added tax shall be deductible as is attributable to the former transactions. This proportion shall be determined, in accordance with Article 19, for all the transactions carried out by the taxable person. However, Member States may: (a) authorize the taxable person to determine a proportion for each sector of his business, provided that separate accounts are kept for each sector; (b) compel the taxable person to determine a proportion for each sector of his business and to keep separate accounts for each sector; (c) authorize or compel the taxable person to make the deduction on the basis of the use of all or part of the goods and services; (d) authorize of compel the taxable person to make the deduction in accordance with the rule laid down in the first subparagraph, in respect of all goods and services used for all transactions referred to therein; (e) provide that where the value added tax which is not deductible by the taxable person is insignificant it shall be treated as nil. 6. Before a period of four years at the latest has elapsed from the date of entry into force of this Directive, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, shall decide what expenditure shall not be eligible for a deduction of value added tax. Value added tax shall in no circumstances be deductible on expenditure which is not strictly business expenditure, such as that on luxuries, amusements or entertainment. Until the above rules come into force, Member States may retain all the exclusions provided for under their national laws when this Directive comes into force. 7. Subject to the consultation provided for in Article 29, each Member State may, for cyclical economic reasons, totally or partly exclude all or some capital goods or other goods from the system of deductions. To maintain identical conditions of competition, Member States may, instead of refusing deduction, tax the goods manufactured by the taxable person himself or which he has purchased in the country or imported, in such a way that the tax does not exceed the value added tax which would have been charged on the acquisition of similar goods. Article 18 Rules governing the exercise of the right to deduct 1. To exercise his right to deduct, the taxable person must: (a) in respect of deductions under Article 17 (2) (a), hold an invoice, drawn up in accordance with Article 22 (3); (b) in respect of deductions under Article 17 (2) (b), hold an import document, specifying him as consignee or importer, and stating or permitting calculation of the amount of tax due; (c) in respect of deductions under Article 17 (2) (c), comply with the formalities established by each Member State; (d) when he is required to pay the tax as a customer or purchaser where Article 21 (1) applies, comply with the formalities laid down by each Member State. 2. The taxable person shall effect the deduction by subtracting from the total amount of value added tax due for a given tax period the total amount of the tax in respect of which, during the same period, the right to deduct has arisen and can be exercised under the provisions of paragraph 1. However, Member States may require that as regards taxable persons who carry out occasional transactions as defined in Article 4 (3), the right to deduct shall be exercised only at the time of the supply. 3. Member States shall determine the conditions and procedures whereby a taxable person may be authorized to make a deduction which he has not made in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2. 4. Where for a given tax period the amount of authorized deductions exceeds the amount of tax due, the Member States may either make a refund or carry the excess forward to the following period according to conditions which they shall determine. However, Member States may refuse to refund or carry forward if the amount of the excess is insignificant. Article 19 Calculation of the deductible proportion 1. The proportion deductible under the first subparagraph of Article 17 (5) shall be made up of a fraction having: - as numerator, the total amount, exclusive of value added tax, of turnover per year attributable to transactions in respect of which value added tax is deductible under Article 17 (2) and (3), - as denominator, the total amount, exclusive of value added tax, of turnover per year attributable to transactions included in the numerator and to transactions in respect of which value added tax is not deductible. The Member States may also include in the denominator the amount of subsidies, other than those specified in Article 11 A (1) (a). The proportion shall be determined on an annual basis, fixed as a percentage and rounded up to a figure not exceeding the next unit. 2. By way of derogation from the provisions of paragraph 1, there shall be excluded from the calculation of the deductible proportion, amounts of turnover attributable to the supplies of capital goods used by the taxable person for the purposes of his business. Amounts of turnover attributable to transactions specified in Article 13 B (d), in so far as these are incidental transactions, and to incidental real estate and financial transactions shall also be excluded. Where Member States exercise the option provided under Article 20 (5) not to require adjustment in respect of capital goods, they may include disposals of capital goods in the calculation of the deductible proportion. 3. The provisional proportion for a year shall be that calculated on the basis of the preceding year's transactions. In the absence of any such transactions to refer to, or where they were insignificant in amount, the deductible proportion shall be estimated provisionally, under supervision of the tax authorities, by the taxable person from his own forecasts. However, Member States may retain their current rules. Deductions made on the basis of such provisional proportion shall be adjusted when the final proportion is fixed during the next year. Article 20 Adjustments of deductions 1. The initial deduction shall be adjusted according to the procedures laid down by the Member States, in particular: (a) where that deduction was higher or lower than that to which the taxable person was entitled; (b) where after the return is made some change occurs in the factors used to determine the amount to be deducted, in particular where purchases are cancelled or price reductions are obtained ; however, adjustment shall not be made in cases of transactions remaining totally or partially unpaid and of destruction, loss or theft of property duly proved or confirmed, nor in the case of applications for the purpose of making gifts of small value and giving samples specified in Article 5 (6). However, Member States may require adjustment in cases of transactions remaining totally or partially unpaid and of theft. 2. In the case of capital goods, adjustment shall be spread over five years including that in which the goods were acquired or manufactured. The annual adjustment shall be made only in respect of one-fifth of the tax imposed on the goods. The adjustment shall be made on the basis of the variations in the deduction entitlement in subsequent years in relation to that for the year in which the goods were acquired or manufactured. By way of derogation from the preceding subparagraph, Member States may base the adjustment on a period of five full years starting from the time at which the goods are first used. In the case of immovable property acquired as capital goods the adjustment period may be extended up to 10 years. 3. In the case of supply during the period of adjustment capital goods shall be regarded as if they had still been applied for business use by the taxable person until expiry of the period of adjustment. Such business activities are presumed to be fully taxed in cases where the delivery of the said goods is taxed ; they are presumed to be fully exempt where the delivery is exempt. The adjustment shall be made only once for the whole period of adjustment still to be covered. However, in the latter case, Member States may waive the requirement for adjustment in so far as the purchaser is a taxable person using the capital goods in question solely for transactions in respect of which value added tax is deductible. 4. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, Member States may: - define the concept of capital goods, - indicate the amount of the tax which is to be taken into consideration for adjustment, - adopt any suitable measures with a view to ensuring that adjustment does not involve any unjustified advantage, - permit administrative simplifications. 5. If in any Member State the practical effect of applying paragraphs 2 and 3 would be insignificant, that Member State may subject to the consultation provided for in Article 29 forego application of these paragraphs having regard to the need to avoid distortion of competition, the overall tax effect in the Member State concerned and the need for due economy of administration. 6. Where the taxable person transfers from being taxed in the normal way to a special scheme or vice versa, Member States may take all necessary measures to ensure that the taxable person neither benefits nor is prejudiced unjustifiably. TITLE XII PERSONS LIABLE FOR PAYMENT FOR TAX Article 21 Persons liable to pay tax to the authorities The following shall be liable to pay value added tax: 1. under the internal system: (a) taxable persons who carry out taxable transactions other than those referred to in Article 9 (2) (e) and carried out by a taxable person resident abroad. When the taxable transaction is effected by a taxable person resident abroad Member States may adopt arrangements whereby tax is payable by someone other than the taxable person residing abroad. Inter alia a tax representative or other person for whom the taxable transaction is carried out may be designated as such other person. The Member States may also provide that someone other than the taxable person shall be held jointly and severally liable for payment of the tax; (b) persons to whom services covered by Article 9 (2) (e) are supplied and carried out by a taxable person resident abroad. However, Member States may require that the supplier of services shall be held jointly and severally liable for payment of the tax; (c) any person who mentions the value added tax on an invoice or other document serving as invoice; 2. on importation : the person or persons designated or accepted as being liable by the Member States into which the goods are imported. TITLE XIII OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS LIABLE FOR PAYMENT Article 22 Obligations under the internal system 1. Every taxable person shall state when his activity as a taxable person commences, changes or ceases. 2. Every taxable person shall keep accounts in sufficient detail to permit application of the value added tax and inspection by the tax authority. 3. (a) Every taxable person shall issue an invoice, or other document serving as invoice in respect of all goods and services supplied by him to another taxable person, and shall keep a copy thereof. Every taxable person shall likewise issue an invoice in respect of payments on account made to him by another taxable person before the supply of goods or services is effected or completed. (b) The invoice shall state clearly the price exclusive of tax and the corresponding tax at each rate as well as any exemptions. (c) The Member States shall determine the criteria for considering whether a document serves as an invoice. 4. Every taxable person shall submit a return within an interval to be determined by each Member State. This interval may not exceed two months following the end of each tax period. The tax period may be fixed by Member States as a month, two months, or a quarter. However, Member States may fix different periods provided that these do not exceed a year. The return must set out all the information needed to calculate the tax that has become chargeable and the deductions to be made, including, where appropriate, and in so far as it seems necessary for the establishment of the tax basis, the total amount of the transactions relative to such tax and deductions, and the total amount of the exempted supplies. 5. Every taxable person shall pay the net amount of the value added tax when submitting the return. The Member States may, however, fix a different date for the payment of the amount or may demand an interim payment. 6. Member States may require a taxable person to submit a statement, including the information specified in paragraph 4, and concerning all transactions carried out the preceding year. This statement must provide all the information necessary for any adjustments. 7. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that those persons who, in accordance with Article 21 (1) (a) and (b), are considered to be liable to pay the tax instead of a taxable person established in another country or who are jointly, and severally liable for the payment, shall comply with the above obligations relating to declaration and payment. 8. Without prejudice to the provisions to be adopted pursuant to Article 17 (4), Member States may impose other obligations which they deem necessary for the correct levying and collection of the tax and for the prevention of fraud. 9. Member States may release taxable persons: - from certain obligations, - from all obligations where those taxable persons carry out only exempt transactions, - from the payment of the tax due where the amount is insignificant. Article 23 Obligations in respect of imports As regards imported goods, Member States shall lay down the detailed rules for the making of the declarations and payments. In particular, Member States may provide that the value added tax payable on importation of goods by taxable persons or persons liable to tax or certain categories of these two need not be paid at the time of importation, on condition that the tax is mentioned as such in a return to be submitted under Article 22 (4). TITLE XIV SPECIAL SCHEMES Article 24 Special scheme for small undertakings 1. Member States which might encounter difficulties in applying the normal tax scheme to small undertakings by reason of their activities or structure shall have the option, under such conditions and within such limits as they may set but subject to the consultation provided for in Article 29, of applying simplified procedures such as flat-rate schemes for charging and collecting the tax provided they do not lead to a reduction thereof. 2. Until a date to be fixed by the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, but which shall not be later than that on which the charging of tax on imports and the remission of tax on exports in trade between the Member States are abolished: (a) Member States which have made use of the option under Article 14 of the second Council Directive of 11 April 1967 to introduce exemptions or graduated tax relief may retain them and the arrangements for applying them if they conform with the value added tax system. Those Member States which apply an exemption from tax to taxable persons whose annual turnover is less than the equivalent in national currency of 5 000 European units of account at the conversion rate of the day on which this Directive is adopted, may increase this exemption up to 5 000 European units of account. Member States which apply graduated tax relief may neither increase the ceiling of the graduated tax reliefs nor render the conditions for the granting of it more favourable; (b) Member States which have not made use of this option may grant an exemption from tax to taxable persons whose annual turnover is at the maximum equal to the equivalent in national currency of 5 000 European units of account at the conversion rate of the day on which this Directive is adopted ; where appropriate, they may grant graduated tax relief to taxable persons whose annual turnover exceeds the ceiling fixed by the Member States for the application of exemption; (c) Member States which apply an exemption from tax to taxable persons whose annual turnover is equal to or higher than the equivalent in national currency of 5 000 European units of account at the conversion rate of the day on which this Directive is adopted, may increase it in order to maintain its value in real terms. 3. The concepts of exemption and graduated tax relief shall apply to the supply of goods and services by small undertakings. Member States may exclude certain transactions from the arrangements provided for in paragraph 2. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not, in any case, apply to the transactions referred to in Article 4 (3). 4. The turnover which shall serve as a reference for the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 2 shall consist of the amount, exclusive of value added tax, of goods and services supplied as defined in Articles 5 and 6, to the extent that they are taxed, including transactions exempted with refund of tax previously paid in accordance with Article 28 (2), and the amount of the transactions exempted pursuant to Article 15, the amount of real property transactions, the financial transactions referred to in Article 13 B (d), and insurance services, unless these transactions are ancillary transactions. However, disposals of tangible or intangible capital assets of an undertaking shall not be taken into account for the purposes of calculating turnover. 5. Taxable persons exempt from tax shall not be entitled to deduct tax in accordance with the provisions of Article 17, nor to show the tax on their invoices or on any other documents serving as invoices. 6. Taxable persons eligible for exemption from tax may opt either for the normal value added tax scheme or for the simplified procedures referred to in paragraph 1. In this case they shall be entitled to any graduated tax relief which may be laid down by national legislation. 7. Subject to the application of paragraph 1, taxable persons enjoying graduated relief shall be treated as taxable persons subject to the normal value added tax scheme. 8. At four-yearly intervals, and for the first time on 1 January 1982, and after consultation of the Member States, the Commission shall report to the Council on the application of the provisions of this Article. It shall as far as may be necessary, and taking into account the need to ensure the long-term convergence of national regulations, attach to this report proposals for: (a) improvements to be made to the special scheme for small undertakings; (b) the adaptation of national systems as regards exemptions and graduated value added tax relief; (c) the adaptation of the limit of 5 000 European units of account mentioned in paragraph 2. 9. The Council will decide at the appropriate time whether the realization of the objective referred to in Article 4 of the first Council Directive of 11 April 1967 requires the introduction of a special scheme for small undertakings and will, if appropriate, decide on the limits and common implementing conditions of this scheme. Until the introduction of such a scheme, Member States may retain their own special schemes which they will apply in accordance with the provisions of this Article and of subsequent acts of the Council. Article 25 Common flat-rate scheme for farmers 1. Where the application to farmers of the normal value added tax scheme, or the simplified scheme provided for in Article 24, would give rise to difficulties, Member States may apply to farmers a flat-rate scheme tending to offset the value added tax charged on purchases of goods and services made by the flat-rate farmers pursuant to this Article. 2. For the purposes of this Article, the following definitions shall apply: - ""farmer"" : a taxable person who carries on his activity in one of the undertakings defined below, - ""agricultural, forestry or fisheries undertakings"" : an undertaking considered to be such by each Member State within the framework of the production activities listed in Annex A, - ""flat-rate farmer"" : a farmer subject to the flat-rate scheme provided for in paragraphs 3 et seq., - ""agricultural products"" : goods produced by an agricultural, forestry or fisheries undertaking in each Member State as a result of the activities listed in Annex A, - ""agricultural service"" : any service as set out in Annex B supplied by a farmer using his labour force and/or by means of the equipment normally available on the agricultural, forestry or fisheries undertaking operated by him, - ""value added tax charge on inputs"" : the amount of the total value added tax attaching to the goods and services purchased by all agricultural, forestry and fisheries undertakings of each Member State subject to the flat-rate scheme where such tax would be deductible under Article 17 by a farmer subject to the normal value added tax scheme, - ""flat-rate compensation percentages"" : the percentages fixed by Member States in accordance with paragraph 3 and applied by them in the cases specified in paragraph 5 to enable flat-rate farmers to offset at a fixed rate the value added tax charge on inputs, - ""flat-rate compensation"" : the amount arrived at by applying the flat-rate compensation percentage provided for in paragraph 3 to the turnover of the flat-rate farmer in the cases referred to in paragraph 5. 3. Member States shall fix the flat-rate compensation percentages, where necessary, and shall notify the Commission before applying them. Such percentages shall be based on macro-economic statistics for flat-rate farmers alone for the preceding three years. They may not be used to obtain for flat-rate farmers refunds greater than the value added tax charges on inputs. Member States shall have the option of reducing such percentages to a nil rate. The percentage may be rounded up or down to the nearest half point. Member States may fix varying flat-rate compensation percentages for forestry, for the different sub-divisions of agriculture and for fisheries. 4. Member States may release flat-rate farmers from the obligations imposed upon taxable persons by Article 22. 5. The flat-rate percentages provided for in paragraph 3 shall be applied to the price, exclusive of tax, of the agricultural products and agricultural services supplied by the flat-rate farmers to taxable persons other than a flat-rate farmer. This compensation shall exclude all other forms of deduction. 6. Member States may provide for the flat-rate compensation to be paid: (a) either by the taxable person to whom the goods or services are supplied. In this case, the taxable person to whom the goods or services are supplied shall be authorized, following the procedure laid down by the Member States, to deduct from the value added tax for which he is liable, the amount of the flat-rate compensation has paid to the flat-rate farmers; (b) or by the public authorities. 7. Member States shall make all necessary provisions to check properly the payment of the flat-rate compensation to the flat-rate farmers. 8. As regards all supplies of agricultural products and agricultural services other than those covered by paragraph 5, the flat-rate compensation is deemed to be paid by the purchaser or customer. 9. Each Member State may exclude from the flat-rate scheme certain categories of farmers and farmers for whom the application of the normal value added tax scheme, or the simplified scheme provided for in Article 24 (1), would not give rise to administrative difficulties. 10. Every flat-rate farmer may opt, subject to the rules and conditions to be laid down by each Member State, for application of the normal value added tax scheme or, as the case may be, the simplified scheme provided for in Article 24 (1). 11. The Commission shall, before the end of the fifth year following the entry into force of this Directive, present to the Council new proposals concerning the application of the value added tax to transactions in respect of agricultural products and services. 12. When they take up the option provided for in this Article the Member States shall fix the uniform basis of assessment of the value added tax in order to apply the scheme of own resources using the common method of calculation in Annex C. Article 26Special scheme for travel agents 1. Member States shall apply value added tax to the operations of travel agents in accordance with the provisions of this Article, where the travel agents deal with customers in their own name and use the supplies and services of other taxable persons in the provision of travel facilities. This Article shall not apply to travel agents who are acting only as intermediaries and accounting for tax in accordance with Article 11 A (3) (c). In this Article travel agents include tour operators. 2. All transactions performed by the travel agent in respect of a journey shall be treated as a single service supplied by the travel agent to the traveller. It shall be taxable in the Member State in which the travel agent has established his business or has a fixed establishment from which the travel agent has provided the services. The taxable amount and the price exclusive of tax, within the meaning of Article 22 (3) (b), in respect of this service shall be the travel agent's margin, that is to say, the difference between the total amount to be paid by the traveller, exclusive of value added tax, and the actual cost to the travel agent of supplies and services provided by other taxable persons where these transactions are for the direct benefit of the traveller. 3. If transactions entrusted by the travel agent to other taxable persons are performed by such persons outside the Community, the travel agent's service shall be treated as an exempted intermediary activity under Article 15 (14). Where these transactions are performed both inside and outside the Community, only that part of the travel agent's service relating to transactions outside the Community may be exempted. 4. Tax charged to the travel agent by other taxable persons on the transactions described in paragraph 2 which are for the direct benefit of the traveller, shall not be eligible for deduction or refund in any Member State. TITLE XV SIMPLIFICATION PROCEDURES Article 27 1. The Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorize any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from the provisions of this Directive, in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance.

A Member State wishing to introduce the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall inform the Commission of them and shall provide the Commission with all relevant information. 3. The Commission shall inform the other Member States of the proposed measures within one month. 4. The Council's decision shall be deemed to have been adopted if, within two months of the other Member States being informed as laid down in the previous paragraph, neither the Commission nor any Member State has requested that the matter be raised by the Council. 5. Those Member States which apply on 1 January 1977 special measures of the type referred to in paragraph 1 above may retain them providing they notify the Commission of them before 1 January 1978 and providing that where such derogations are designed to simplify the procedure for charging tax they conform with the requirement laid down in paragraph 1 above.

Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to ensure that taxable persons declare the data required to determine own resources relating to these operations. On the basis of a report from the Commission, the Council shall review the abovementioned reduced rates and exemptions every five years and, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, shall where appropriate, adopt the measures required to ensure the progressive abolition thereof. 3. During the transitional period referred to in paragraph 4, Member States may: (a) continue to subject to tax the transactions exempt under Article 13 or 15 set out in Annex E to this Directive; (b) continue to exempt the activities set out in Annex F under conditions existing in the Member State concerned; (c) grant to taxable persons the option for taxation of exempt transactions under the conditions set out in Annex G; (d) continue to apply provisions derogating from the principle of immediate deduction laid down in the first paragraph of Article 18 (2); (e) continue to apply measures derogating from the provisions of Articles 5 (4) (c), 6 (4) and 11 A (3) (c); (f) provide that for supplies of buildings and building land purchased for the purpose of resale by a taxable person for whom tax on the purchase was not deductible, the taxable amount shall be the difference between the selling price and the purchase price; (g) by way of derogation from Articles 17 (3) and 26 (3), continue to exempt without repayment of input tax the services of travel agents referred to in Article 26 (3).

At the latest six months before the end of this period, and subsequently as necessary, the Council shall review the situation with regard to the derogations set out in paragraph 3 on the basis of a report from the Commission and shall unanimously determine on a proposal from the Commission, whether any or all of these derogations shall be abolished. 5.

When converting this unit of account into national currencies, Member States shall have the option of rounding the amounts resulting from this conversion either upwards or downwards by up to 10 %. Article 32 Second-hand goods The Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt before 31 December 1977 a Community taxation system to be applied to used goods, works of art, antiques and collectors' items. Until this Community system becomes applicable, Member States applying a special system to these items at the time this Directive comes into force may retain that system. Article 33 Without prejudice to other Community provisions, the provisions of this Directive shall not prevent a Member State from maintaining or introducing taxes on insurance contracts, taxes on betting and gambling, excise duties, stamp duties and, more generally, any taxes, duties or charges which cannot be characterized as turnover taxes.

Article 36 The fourth paragraph of Article 2 and Article 5 of the first Council Directive of 11 April 1967 are repealed.

A lawyer pursuing these activities shall observe the rules of professional conduct of the host Member State, without prejudice to his obligations in the Member State from which he comes. 3. When these activities are pursued in the United Kingdom, ""rules of professional conduct of the host Member State"" means the rules of professional conduct applicable to solicitors, where such activities are not reserved for barristers and advocates. Otherwise the rules of professional conduct applicable to the latter shall apply. However, barristers from Ireland shall always be subject to the rules of professional conduct applicable in the United Kingdom to barristers and advocates. When these activities are pursued in Ireland ""rules of professional conduct of the host Member State"" means, in so far as they govern the oral presentation of a case in court, the rules of professional conduct applicable to barristers.

If the business preserves its autonomy, the status and function, as laid down by the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States, of the representatives or of the representation of the employees affected by the transfer within the meaning of Article 1 (1) shall be preserved.

If the transferor or the transferee envisages measures in relation to his employees, he shall consult his representatives of the employees in good time on such measures with a view to seeking agreement. 3. Member States whose laws, regulations or administrative provisions provide that representatives of the employees may have recourse to an arbitration board to obtain a decision on the measures to be taken in relation to employees may limit the obligations laid down in paragraphs 1 and 2 to cases where the transfer carried out gives rise to a change in the business likely to entail serious disadvantages for a considerable number of the employees. The information and consultations shall cover at least the measures envisaged in relation to the employees. The information must be provided and consultations take place in good time before the change in the business as referred to in the first subparagraph is effected. 4.

In so far as the laws of the Member States make use of this option, they shall require such companies to include the words ""investment company with variable capital"" or ""cooperative"" in all documents indicated in Article 4 of Directive 68/151/EEC. The expression ""investment company with variable capital"", within the meaning of this Directive, means only those companies: - the exclusive object of which is to invest their funds in various stocks and shares, land or other assets with the sole aim of spreading investment risks and giving their shareholders the benefit of the results of the management of their assets, - which offer their own shares for subscription by the public, and - the statutes of which provide that, within the limits of a minimum and maximum capital, they may at any time issue, redeem or resell their shares.

Article 3 The following information at least must appear in either the statutes or the instrument of incorporation or a separate document published in accordance with the procedure laid down in the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC: (a) the registered office; (b) the nominal value of the shares subscribed and, at least once a year, the number thereof; (c) the number of shares subscribed without stating the nominal value, where such shares may be issued under national law; (d) the special conditions if any limiting the transfer of shares; (e) where there are several classes of shares, the information under (b), (c) and (d) for each class and the rights attaching to the shares of each class; (f) whether the shares are registered or bearer, where national law provides for both types, and any provisions relating to the conversion of such shares unless the procedure is laid down by law; (g) the amount of the subscribed capital paid up at the time the company is incorporated or is authorized to commence business; (h) the nominal value of the shares or, where there is not nominal value, the number of shares issued for a consideration other than in cash, together with the nature of the consideration and the name of the person providing this consideration; (i) the identity of the natural or legal persons or companies or firms by whom or in whose name the statutes or the instrument of incorporation, or where the company was not formed at the same time, the drafts of these documents, have been signed; (j) the total amount, or at least an estimate, of all the costs payable by the company or chargeable to it by reason of its formation and, where appropriate, before the company is authorized to commence business; (k) any special advantage granted, at the time the company is formed or up to the time it receives authorization to commence business, to anyone who has taken part in the formation of the company or in transactions leading to the grant of such authorization. Article 4 1. Where the laws of a Member State prescribe that a company may not commence business without authorization, they shall also make provision for responsibility for liabilities incurred by or on behalf of the company during the period before such authorization is granted or refused. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to liabilities under contracts concluded by the company conditionally upon its being granted authorization to commence business. Article 5 1. Where the laws of a Member State require a company to be formed by more than one member, the fact that all the shares are held by one person or that the number of members has fallen below the legal minimum after incorporation of the company shall not lead to the automatic dissolution of the company. 2. If in the cases referred to in paragraph 1, the laws of a Member State permit the company to be wound up by order of the court, the judge having jurisdiction must be able to give the company sufficient time to regularize its position. 3. Where such a winding up order is made the company shall enter into liquidation. Article 6 1. The laws of the Member States shall require that, in order that a company may be incorporated or obtain authorization to commence business, a minimum capital shall be subscribed the amount of which shall be not less than 25 000 European units of account.

Every five years the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall examine and, if need be, revise the amounts expressed in this Article in European units of account in the light of economic and monetary trends in the Community and of the tendency towards allowing only large and medium-sized undertakings to opt for the types of company listed in Article 1 (1). Article 7 The subscribed capital may be formed only of assets capable of economic assessment. However, an undertaking to perform work or supply services may not form part of these assets. Article 8 1. Shares may not be issued at a price lower than their nominal value, or, where there is no nominal value, their accountable par. 2. However, Member States may allow those who undertake to place shares in the exercise of their profession to pay less than the total price of the shares for which they subscribe in the course of this transaction. Article 9 1. Shares issued for a consideration must be paid up at the time the company is incorporated or is authorized to commence business at not less than 25 % of their nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, their accountable par. 2. However, where shares are issued for a consideration other than in cash at the time the company is incorporated or is authorized to commence business, the consideration must be transferred in full within five years of that time. Article 10 1. A report on any consideration other than in cash shall be drawn up before the company is incorporated or is authorized to commence business, by one or more independent experts appointed or approved by an administrative or judicial authority. Such experts may be natural persons as well as legal persons and companies or firms under the laws of each Member State. 2. The experts' report shall contain at least a description of each of the assets comprising the consideration as well as of the methods of valuation used and shall state whether the values arrived at by the application of these methods correspond at least to the number and nominal value or, where there is no nominal value, to the accountable par and, where appropriate, to the premium on the shares to be issued for them. 3. The expert's report shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC. 4. Member States may decide not to apply this Article where 90 % of the nominal value, or where there is no nominal value, of the accountable par, of all the shares is issued to one or more companies for a consideration other than in cash, and where the following requirements are met: (a) with regard to the company in receipt of such consideration, the persons referred to in Article 3 (i) have agreed to dispense with the expert's report; (b) such agreement has been published as provided for in paragraph 3; (c) the companies furnishing such consideration have reserves which may not be distributed under the law or the statutes and which are at least equal to the nominal value or, where there is no nominal value, the accountable par of the shares issued for consideration other than in cash; (d) the companies furnishing such consideration guarantee, up to an amount equal to that indicated in paragraph (c), the debts of the recipient company arising between the time the shares are issued for a consideration other than in cash and one year after the publication of that company's annual accounts for the financial year during which such consideration was furnished. Any transfer of these shares is prohibited within this period; (e) the guarantee referred to in (d) has been published as provided for in paragraph 3; (f) the companies furnishing such consideration shall place a sum equal to that indicated in (c) into a reserve which may not be distributed until three years after publication of the annual accounts of the recipient company for the financial year during which such consideration was furnished or, if necessary, until such later date as all claims relating to the guarantee referred to in (d) which are submitted during this period have been settled. Article 11 1. If, before the expiry of a time limit laid down by national law of at least two years from the time the company is incorporated or is authorized to commence business, the company acquires any asset belonging to a person or company or firm referred to in Article 3 (i) for a consideration of not less than one-tenth of the subscribed capital, the acquisition shall be examined and details of it published in the manner provided for in Article 10 and it shall be submitted for the approval of the general meeting. Member States may also require these provisions to be applied when the assets belong to a shareholder or to any other person. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to acquisitions effected in the normal course of the company's business, to acquisitions effected at the instance or under the supervision of an administrative or judicial authority, or to stock exchange acquisitions. Article 12 Subject to the provisions relating to the reduction of subscribed capital, the shareholders may not be released from the obligation to pay up their contributions. Article 13 Pending coordination of national laws at a subsequent date, Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to require provision of at least the same safeguards as are laid down in Articles 2 to 12 in the event of the conversion of another type of company into a public limited liability company. Article 14 Articles 2 to 13 shall not prejudice the provisions of Member States on competence and procedure relating to the modification of the statutes or of the instrument of incorporation. Article 15 1. (a) Except for cases of reductions of subscribed capital, no distribution to shareholders may be made when on the closing date of the last financial year the net assets as set out in the company's annual accounts are, or following such a distribution would become, lower than the amount of the subscribed capital plus those reserves which may not be distributed under the law or the statutes. (b) Where the uncalled part of the subscribed capital is not included in the assets shown in the balance sheet, this amount shall be deducted from the amount of subscribed capital referred to in paragraph (a). (c) The amount of a distribution to shareholders may not exceed the amount of the profits at the end of the last financial year plus any profits brought forward and sums drawn from reserves available for this purpose, less any losses brought forward and sums placed to reserve in accordance with the law or the statutes. (d) The expression ""distribution"" used in subparagraphs (a) and (c) includes in particular the payment of dividends and of interest relating to shares. 2. When the laws of a Member State allow the payment of interim dividends, the following conditions at least shall apply: (a) interim accounts shall be drawn up showing that the funds available for distribution are sufficient, (b) the amount to be distributed may not exceed the total profits made since the end of the last financial year for which the annual accounts have been drawn up, plus any profits brought forward and sums drawn from reserves available for this purpose, less losses brought forward and sums to be placed to reserve pursuant to the requirements of the law or the statutes. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not affect the provisions of the Member States as regards increases in subscribed capital by capitalization of reserves. 4. The laws of a Member State may provide for derogations from paragraph 1 (a) in the case of investment companies with fixed capital. The expression ""investment company with fixed capital"", within the meaning of this paragraph means only those companies: - the exclusive object of which is to invest their funds in various stocks and shares, land or other assets with the sole aim of spreading investment risks and giving their shareholders the benefit of the results of the management of their assets, and - which offer their own shares for subscription by the public. In so far as the laws of Member States make use of this option they shall: (a) require such companies to include the expression ""investment company"" in all documents indicated in Article 4 of Directive 68/151/EEC; (b) not permit any such company whose net assets fall below the amount specified in paragraph 1 (a) to make a distribution to shareholders when on the closing date of the last financial year the company's total assets as set out in the annual accounts are, or following such distribution would become, less than one-and-a-half times the amount of the company's total liabilities to creditors as set out in the annual accounts; (c) require any such company which makes a distribution when its net assets fall below the amount specified in paragraph 1 (a) to include in its annual accounts a note to that effect. Article 16 Any distribution made contrary to Article 15 must be returned by shareholders who have received it if the company proves that these shareholders knew of the irregularity of the distributions made to them, or could not in view of the circumstances have been unaware of it. Article 17 1. In the case of a serious loss of the subscribed capital, a general meeting of shareholders must be called within the period laid down by the laws of the Member States, to consider whether the company should be wound up or any other measures taken. 2. The amount of a loss deemed to be serious within the meaning of paragraph 1 may not be set by the laws of Member States at a figure higher than half the subscribed capital. Article 18 1. The shares of a company may not be subscribed for by the company itself. 2. If the shares of a company have been subscribed for by a person acting in his own name, but on behalf of the company, the subscriber shall be deemed to have subscribed for them for his own account. 3. The persons or companies or firms referred to in Article 3 (i) or, in cases of an increase in subscribed capital, the members of the administrative or management body shall be liable to pay for shares subscribed in contravention of this Article. However, the laws of a Member State may provide that any such person may be released from his obligation if he proves that no fault is attributable to him personally. Article 19 1. Where the laws of a Member State permit a company to acquire its own shares, either itself or through a person acting in his own name but on the company's behalf, they shall make such acquisitions subject to at least the following conditions: (a) authorization shall be given by the general meeting, which shall determine the terms and conditions of such acquisitions, and in particular the maximum number of shares to be acquired, the duration of the period for which the authorization is given and which may not exceed 18 months, and, in the case of acquisition for value, the maximum and minimum consideration. Members of the administrative or management body shall be required to satisfy themselves that at the time when each authorized acquisition is effected the conditions referred to in subparagraphs (b), (c) and (d) are respected; (b) the nominal value or, in the absence thereof, the accountable par of the acquired shares, including shares previously acquired by the company and held by it, and shares acquired by a person acting in his own name but on the company's behalf, may not exceed 10 % of the subscribed capital; (c) the acquisitions may not have the effect of reducing the net assets below the amount mentioned in Article 15 (1) (a); (d) only fully paid-up shares may be included in the transaction. 2. The laws of a Member State may provide for derogations from the first sentence of paragraph 1 (a) where the acquisition of a company's own shares is necessary to prevent serious and imminent harm to the company. In such a case, the next general meeting must be informed by the administrative or management body of the reasons for and nature of the acquisitions effected, of the number and nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, the accountable par, of the shares acquired, of the proportion of the subscribed capital which they represent, and of the consideration for these shares. 3. Member States may decide not to apply the first sentence of paragraph 1 (a) to shares acquired by either the company itself or by a person acting in his own name but on the company's behalf, for distribution to that company's employees or to the employees of an associate company. Such shares must be distributed within 12 months of their acquisition. Article 20 1. Member States may decide not to apply Article 19 to: (a) shares acquired in carrying out a decision to reduce capital, or in the circumstances referred to in Article 39; (b) shares acquired as a result of a universal transfer of assets; (c) fully paid-up shares acquired free of charge or by banks and other financial institutions as purchasing commission; (d) shares acquired by virtue of a legal obligation or resulting from a court ruling for the protection of minority shareholders in the event, particularly, of a merger, a change in the company's object or form, transfer abroad of the registered office, or the introduction of restrictions on the transfer of shares; (e) shares acquired from a shareholder in the event of failure to pay them up; (f) shares acquired in order to indemnify minority shareholders in associated companies; (g) fully paid-up shares acquired under a sale enforced by a court order for the payment of a debt owed to the company by the owner of the shares; (h) fully paid-up shares issued by an investment company with fixed capital, as defined in the second subparagraph of Article 15 (4), and acquired at the investor's request by that company or by an associate company. Article 15 (4) (a) shall apply. These acquisitions may not have the effect of reducing the net assets below the amount of the subscribed capital plus any reserves the distribution of which is forbidden by law. 2. Shares acquired in the cases listed in paragraph 1 (b) to (g) above must, however, be disposed of within not more than three years of their acquisition unless the nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, the accountable par of the shares acquired, including shares which the company may have acquired through a person acting in his own name but on the company's behalf, does not exceed 10 % of the subscribed capital. 3. If the shares are not disposed of within the period laid down in paragraph 2, they must be cancelled. The laws of a Member State may make this cancellation subject to a corresponding reduction in the subscribed capital. Such a reduction must be prescribed where the acquisition of shares to be cancelled results in the net assets having fallen below the amount specified in Article 15 (1) (a). Article 21 Shares acquired in contravention of Articles 19 and 20 shall be disposed of within one year of their acquisition. Should they not be disposed of within that period, Article 20 (3) shall apply. Article 22 1. Where the laws of a Member State permit a company to acquire its own shares, either itself or through a person acting in his own name but on the company's behalf, they shall make the holding of these shares at all times subject to at least the following conditions: (a) among the rights attaching to the shares, the right to vote attaching to the company's own shares shall in any event be suspended; (b) if the shares are included among the assets shown in the balance sheet, a reserve of the same amount, unavailable for distribution, shall be included among the liabilities. 2. Where the laws of a Member State permit a company to acquire its own shares, either itself or through a person acting in his own name but on the company's behalf, they shall require the annual report to state at least: (a) the reasons for acquisitions made during the financial year; (b) the number and nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, the accountable par of the shares acquired and disposed of during the financial year and the proportion of the subscribed capital which they represent; (c) in the case of acquisition or disposal for a value, the consideration for the shares; (d) the number and nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, the accountable par of all the shares acquired and held by the company and the proportion of the subscribed capital which they represent. Article 23 1. A company may not advance funds, nor make loans, nor provide security, with a view to the acquisition of its shares by a third party. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to transactions concluded by banks and other financial institutions in the normal course of business, nor to transactions effected with a view to the acquisition of shares by or for the company's employees or the employees of an associate company. However, these transactions may not have the effect of reducing the net assets below the amount specified in Article 15 (1) (a). 3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to transactions effected with a view to acquisition of shares as described in Article 20 (1) (h). Article 24 1. The acceptance of the company's own shares as security, either by the company itself or through a person acting in his own name but on the company's behalf, shall be treated as an acquisition for the purposes of Articles 19, 20 (1), 22 and 23. 2. The Member States may decide not to apply paragraph 1 to transactions concluded by banks and other financial institutions in the normal course of business. Article 25 1. Any increase in capital must be decided upon by the general meeting. Both this decision and the increase in the subscribed capital shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC. 2. Nevertheless, the statutes or instrument of incorporation or the general meeting, the decision of which must be published in accordance with the rules referred to in paragraph 1, may authorize an increase in the subscribed capital up to a maximum amount which they shall fix with due regard for any maximum amount provided for by law. Where appropriate, the increase in the subscribed capital shall be decided on within the limits of the amount fixed, by the company body empowered to do so. The power of such body in this respect shall be for a maximum period of five years and may be renewed one or more times by the general meeting, each time for a period not exceeding five years. 3. Where there are several classes of shares, the decision by the general meeting concerning the increase in capital referred to in paragraph 1 or the authorization to increase the capital referred to in paragraph 2, shall be subject to a separate vote at least for each class of shareholder whose rights are affected by the transaction. 4. This Article shall apply to the issue of all securities which are convertible into shares or which carry the right to subscribe for shares, but not to the conversion of such securities, nor to the exercise of the right to subscribe. Article 26 Shares issued for a consideration, in the course of an increase in subscribed capital, must be paid up to at least 25 % of their nominal value or, in the absence of a nominal value, of their accountable par. Where provision is made for an issue premium, it must be paid in full. Article 27 1. Where shares are issued for a consideration other than in cash in the course of an increase in the subscribed capital the consideration must be transferred in full within a period of five years from the decision to increase the subscribed capital. 2. The consideration referred to in paragraph 1 shall be the subject of a report drawn up before the increase in capital is made by one or more experts who are independent of the company and appointed or approved by an administrative or judicial authority. Such experts may be natural persons as well as legal persons and companies and firms under the laws of each Member State. Article 10 (2) and (3) shall apply. 3. Member States may decide not to apply paragraph 2 in the event of an increase in subscribed capital made in order to give effect to a merger or a public offer for the purchase or exchange of shares and to pay the shareholders of the company which is being absorbed or which is the object of the public offer for the purchase or exchange of shares. 4. Member States may decide not to apply paragraph 2 if all the shares issued in the course of an increase in subscribed capital are issued for a consideration other than in cash to one or more companies, on condition that all the shareholders in the company which receive the consideration have agreed not to have an experts' report drawn up and that the requirements of Article 10 (4) (b) to (f) are met. Article 28 Where an increase in capital is not fully subscribed, the capital will be increased by the amount of the subscriptions received only if the conditions of the issue so provide. Article 29 1. Whenever the capital is increased by consideration in cash, the shares must be offered on a pre-emptive basis to shareholders in proportion to the capital represented by their shares. 2. The laws of a Member State: (a) need not apply paragraph 1 above to shares which carry a limited right to participate in distributions within the meaning of Article 15 and/or in the company's assets in the event of liquidation ; or (b) may permit, where the subscribed capital of a company having several classes of shares carrying different rights with regard to voting, or participation in distributions within the meaning of Article 15 or in assets in the event of liquidation, is increased by issuing new shares in only one of these classes, the right of pre-emption of shareholders of the other classes to be exercised only after the exercise of this right by the shareholders of the class in which the new shares are being issued. 3. Any offer of subscription on a pre-emptive basis and the period within which this right must be exercised shall be published in the national gazette appointed in accordance with Directive 68/151/EEC. However, the laws of a Member State need not provide for such publication where all a company's shares are registered. In such case, all the company's shareholders must be informed in writing. The right of pre-emption must be exercised within a period which shall not be less than 14 days from the date of publication of the offer or from the date of dispatch of the letters to the shareholders. 4. The right of pre-emption may not be restricted or withdrawn by the statutes or instrument of incorporation. This may, however, be done by decision of the general meeting. The administrative or management body shall be required to present to such a meeting a written report indicating the reasons for restriction or withdrawal of the right of pre-emption, and justifying the proposed issue price. The general meeting shall act in accordance with the rules for a quorum and a majority laid down in Article 40. Its decision shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC. 5. The laws of a Member State may provide that the statutes, the instrument of incorporation or the general meeting, acting in accordance with the rules for a quorum, a majority and publication set out in paragraph 4, may give the power to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption to the company body which is empowered to decide on an increase in subscribed capital within the limits of the authorized capital. This power may not be granted for a longer period than the power for which provision is made in Article 25 (2). 6. Paragraphs 1 to 5 shall apply to the issue of all securities which are convertible into shares or which carry the right to subscribe for shares, but not to the conversion of such securities, nor to the exercice of the right to subscribe. 7. The right of pre-emption is not excluded for the purposes of paragraphs 4 and 5 where, in accordance with the decision to increase the subscribed capital, shares are issued to banks or other financial institutions with a view to their being offered to shareholders of the company in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 3. Article 30 Any reduction in the subscribed capital, except under a court order, must be subject at least to a decision of the general meeting acting in accordance with the rules for a quorum and a majority laid down in Article 40 without prejudice to Articles 36 and 37. Such decision shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC. The notice convening the meeting must specify at least the purpose of the reduction and the way in which it is to be carried out. Article 31 Where there are several classes of shares, the decision by the general meeting concerning a reduction in the subscribed capital shall be subject to a separate vote, at least for each class of shareholders whose rights are affected by the transaction. Article 32 1. In the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, at least the creditors whose claims antedate the publication of the decision to make the reduction shall be entitled at least to have the right to obtain security for claims which have not fallen due by the date of that publication. The laws of a Member State shall lay down the conditions for the exercise of this right. They may not set aside such right unless the creditor has adequate safeguards, or unless the latter are not necessary in view of the assets of the company. 2. The laws of the Member States shall also stipulate at least that the reduction shall be void or that no payment may be made for the benefit of the shareholders, until the creditors have obtained satisfaction or a court has decided that their application should not be acceded to. 3. This Article shall apply where the reduction in the subscribed capital is brought about by the total or partial waiving of the payment of the balance of the shareholders' contributions. Article 33 1. Member States need not apply Article 32 to a reduction in the subscribed capital whose purpose is to offset losses incurred or to include sums of money in a reserve provided that, following this operation, the amount of such reserve is not more than 10 % of the reduced subscribed capital. Except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, this reserve may not be distributed to shareholders ; it may be used only for offsetting losses incurred or for increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalization of such reserve, in so far as the Member States permit such an operation. 2. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 the laws of the Member States must at least provide for the measures necessary to ensure that the amounts deriving from the reduction of subscribed capital may not be used for making payments or distributions to shareholders or discharging shareholders from the obligation to make their contributions. Article 34 The subscribed capital may not be reduced to an amount less than the minimum capital laid down in accordance with Article 6. However, Member States may permit such a reduction if they also provide that the decision to reduce the subscribed capital may take effect only when the subscribed capital is increased to an amount at least equal to the prescribed minimum. Article 35 Where the laws of a Member State authorize total or partial redemption of the subscribed capital without reduction of the latter, they shall at least require that the following conditions are observed: (a) where the statutes or instrument of incorporation provide for redemption, the latter shall be decided on by the general meeting voting at least under the usual conditions of quorum and majority. Where the statutes or instrument of incorporation do not provide for redemption, the latter shall be decided upon by the general meeting acting at least under the conditions of quorum and majority laid down in Article 40. The decision must be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC; (b) only sums which are available for distribution within the meaning of Article 15 (1) may be used for redemption purposes; (c) shareholders whose shares are redeemed shall retain their rights in the company, with the exception of their rights to the repayment of their investment and participation in the distribution of an initial dividend on unredeemed shares. Article 361. Where the laws of a Member State may allow companies to reduce their subscribed capital by compulsory withdrawal of shares, they shall require that at least the following conditions are observed: (a) compulsory withdrawal must be prescribed or authorized by the statutes or instrument of incorporation before subscription of the shares which are to be withdrawn are subscribed for; (b) where the compulsory withdrawal is merely authorized by the statutes or instrument of incorporation, it shall be decided upon by the general meeting unless it has been unanimously approved by the shareholders concerned; (c) the company body deciding on the compulsory withdrawal shall fix the terms and manner thereof, where they have not already been fixed by the statutes or instrument of incorporation; (d) Article 32 shall apply except in the case of fully paid-up shares which are made available to the company free of charge or are withdrawn using sums available for distribution in accordance with Article 15 (1) ; in these cases, an amount equal to the nominal value or, in the absence thereof, to the accountable par of all the withdrawn shares must be included in a reserve. Except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital this reserve may not be distributed to shareholders. It can be used only for offsetting losses incurred or for increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalization of such reserve, in so far as Member States permit such an operation; (e) the decision on compulsory withdrawal shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC. 2. Articles 30 (1), 31, 33 and 40 shall not apply to the cases to which paragraph 1 refers. Article 37 1. In the case of a reduction in the subscribed capital by the withdrawal of shares acquired by the company itself or by a person acting in his own name but on behalf of the company, the withdrawal must always be decided on by the general meeting. 2. Article 32 shall apply unless the shares are fully paid up and are acquired free of charge or using sums available for distribution in accordance with Article 15 (1) ; in these cases an amount equal to the nominal value or, in the absence thereof, to the accountable par of all the shares withdrawn must be included in a reserve. Except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital, this reserve may not be distributed to shareholders. It may be used only for offsetting losses incurred or for increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalization of such reserve, in so far as the Member States permit such an operation. 3. Articles 31, 33 and 40 shall not apply to the cases to which paragraph 1 refers. Article 38 In the cases covered by Articles 35, 36 (1) (b) and 37 (1), when there are several classes of shares, the decision by the general meeting concerning redemption of the subscribed capital or its reduction by withdrawal of shares shall be subject to a separate vote, at least for each class of shareholders whose rights are affected by the transaction. Article 39 Where the laws of a Member State authorize companies to issue redeemable shares, they shall require that the following conditions, at least, are complied with for the redemption of such shares: (a) redemption must be authorized by the company's statutes or instrument of incorporation before the redeemable shares are subscribed for; (b) the shares must be fully paid up; (c) the terms and the manner of redemption must be laid down in the company's statutes or instrument of incorporation; (d) redemption can be only effected by using sums available for distribution in accordance with Article 15 (1) or the proceeds of a new issue made with a view to effecting such redemption; (e) an amount equal to the nominal value or, in the absence thereof, to the accountable par of all the redeemed shares must be included in a reserve which cannot be distributed to the shareholders, except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital ; it may be used only for the purpose of increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalization of reserves; (f) subparagraph (e) shall not apply to redemption using the proceeds of a new issue made with a view to effecting such redemption; (g) where provision is made for the payment of a premium to shareholders in consequence of a redemption, the premium may be paid only from sums available for distribution in accordance with Article 15 (1), or from a reserve other than that referred to in (e) which may not be distributed to shareholders except in the event of a reduction in the subscribed capital ; this reserve may be used only for the purposes of increasing the subscribed capital by the capitalization of reserves or for covering the costs referred to in Article 3 (j) or the cost of issuing shares or debentures or for the payment of a premium to holders of redeemable shares or debentures; (h) notification of redemption shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC. Article 40 1. The laws of the Member States shall provide that the decisions referred to in Articles 29 (4) and (5), 30, 31, 35 and 38 must be taken at least by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the votes attaching to the securities or the subscribed capital represented. 2. The laws of the Member States may, however, lay down that a simple majority of the votes specified in paragraph 1 is sufficient when at least half the subscribed capital is represented. Article 41 1. Member States may derogate from Article 9 (1), Article 19 (1) (a), first sentence, and (b) and from Articles 25, 26 and 29 to the extent that such derogations are necessary for the adoption or application of provisions designed to encourage the participation of employees, or other groups of persons defined by national law, in the capital of undertakings. 2. Member States may decide not to apply Article 19 (1) (a), first sentence, and Articles 30, 31, 36, 37, 38 and 39 to companies incorporated under a special law which issue both capital shares and workers' shares, the latter being issued to the company's employees as a body, who are represented at general meetings of shareholders by delegates having the right to vote. Article 42 For the purposes of the implementation of this Directive, the laws of the Member States shall ensure equal treatment to all shareholders who are in the same position. Article 43 1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions needed in order to comply with this Directive within two years of its notification. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 2. Member States may decide not to apply Article 3 (g), (i), (j) and (k) to companies already in existence at the date of entry into force of the provisions referred to in paragraph 1. They may provide that the other provisions of this Directive shall not apply to such companies until 18 months after that date. However, this time limit may be three years in the case of Articles 6 and 9 and five years in the case of unregistered companies in the United Kingdom and Ireland. 3. Member States shall ensure that they communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.

Where values appear in column G of the Annex, whether or not there is a corresponding value in column I of the Annex, Member States shall endeavour, subject to Article 7, to observe them as guidelines. Article 4 1. Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that, within 10 years following the notification of this Directive, the quality of bathing water conforms to the limit values set in accordance with Article 3. 2. Member States shall ensure that, in bathing areas specially equipped for bathing to be created by the competent authorities of the Member States after the notification of this Directive, the ""I values"" laid down in the Annex are observed from the time when bathing is first permitted. However, for bathing areas created during the two years following the notification of this Directive, these values need not be observed until the end of that period. 3. In exceptional circumstances Member States may grant derogations in respect of the 10-year time limit laid down in paragraph 1. Justifications for any such derogations based on plans for the management of water within the area concerned must be communicated to the Commission as soon as possible and not later than six years following the notification of this Directive. The Commission shall examine these justifications in detail and, where necessary, make appropriate proposals concerning them to the Council. 4. As regards sea water in the vicinity of frontiers and water crossing frontiers which affect the quality of the bathing water of another Member State, the consequences for the common quality objectives for bathing areas so affected shall be determined in collaboration by the riparian Member States concerned. The Commission may participate in these deliberations. Article 5 1. For the purposes of Article 4, bathing water shall be deemed to conform to the relevant parameters: if samples of that water, taken at the same sampling point and at the intervals specified in the Annex, show that it conforms to the parametric values for the quality of the water concerned, in the case of: - 95 % of the samples for parameters corresponding to those specified in column I of the Annex; - 90 % of the samples in all other cases with the exception of the ""total coliform"" and ""faecal coliform"" parameters where the percentage may be 80 % and if, in the case of the 5, 10 or 20 % of the samples which do not comply: - the water does not deviate from the parametric values in question by more than 50 %, except for microbiological parameters, pH and dissolved oxygen; - consecutive water samples taken at statistically suitable intervals do not deviate from the relevant parametric values. 2. Deviations from the values referred to in Article 3 shall not be taken into consideration in the calculation of the percentage referred to in paragraph 1 when they are the result of floods, other natural disasters or abnormal weather conditions. Article 6 1. The competent authorities in the Member States shall carry out sampling operations, the minimum frequency of which is laid down in the Annex. 2. Samples should be taken at places where the daily average density of bathers is highest. Samples should preferably be taken 30 cm below the surface of the water except for mineral oil samples which shall be taken at surface level. Sampling should begin two weeks before the start of the bathing season. 3. Local investigation of the conditions prevailing upstream in the case of fresh running water, and of the ambient conditions in the case of fresh still water and sea water should be carried out scrupulously and repeated periodically in order to obtain geographical and topographical data and to determine the volume and nature of all polluting and potentially polluting discharges and their effects according to the distance from the bathing area. 4. Should inspection by a competent authority or sampling operations reveal that there is a discharge or a probable discharge of substances likely to lower the quality of the bathing water, additional sampling must take place. Such additional sampling must also take place if there are any other grounds for suspecting that there is a decrease in water quality. 5. Reference methods of analysis for the parameters concerned are set out in the Annex. Laboratories which employ other methods must ensure that the results obtained are equivalent or comparable to those specified in the Annex. Article 7 1. Implementation of the measures taken pursuant to this Directive may under no circumstances lead either directly or indirectly to deterioration of the current quality of bathing water. 2. Member States may at any time fix more stringent values for bathing water than those laid down in this Directive. Article 8 This Directive may be waived: (a) in the case of certain parameters marked (0) in the Annex, because of exceptional weather or geographical conditions; (b) when bathing water undergoes natural enrichment in certain substances causing a deviation from the values prescribed in the Annex. Natural enrichment means the process whereby, without human intervention, a given body of water receives from the soil certain substances contained therein. In no case may the exceptions provided for in this Article disregard the requirements essential for public health protection. Where a Member State waives the provisions of this Directive, it shall forthwith notify the Commission thereof, stating its reasons and the periods anticipated. Article 9 Such amendments as are necessary for adapting this Directive to technical progress shall relate to: - the methods of analysis - the G and I parameter values set out in the Annex. They shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 11. Article 10 1. A Committee on Adaptation to Technical Progress (hereinafter called ""the committee"") is hereby set up. It shall consist of representatives of the Member States and be chaired by a representative of the Commission. 2. The committee shall draw up its own rules of procedure. Article 11 1. Where the procedure laid down in this Article is to be followed, matters shall be referred to the committee by the chairman, either on his own initiative or at the request of the representative of a Member State. 2. The representative of the Commission shall submit to the committee a draft of the measures to be adopted. The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit set by the chairman having regard to the urgency of the matter. Opinions shall be adopted by a majority of 41 votes, the votes of the Member States being weighted as provided in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty. The chairman shall not vote. 3. (a) The Commission shall adopt the measures envisaged where they are in accordance with the opinion of the committee. (b) Where the measures envisaged are not in accordance with the opinion of the committee, or if no opinion is adopted, the Commission shall without delay propose to the Council the measures to be adopted. The Council shall act by a qualified majority. (c) If, within three months of the proposal being submitted to it, the Council has not acted, the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Commission. Article 12 1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive within two years of its notification. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 2. Member States will communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. Article 13 Member States shall, four years following the notification of this Directive and at regular intervals thereafter, submit a comprehensive report to the Commission on their bathing water and the most significant characteristics thereof. After prior consent has been obtained from the Member State concerned the Commission may publish the information obtained. Article 14 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

"60","31975L0268","TITLE I Introduction of a special system of aids to assist the less-favoured farming areas Article 1 In order to ensure the continuation of farming, thereby maintaining a minimum population level or conserving the countryside in certain less-favoured areas the list of which is determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 2, Member States are authorized to introduce the special system of aids provided for in Article 4 to encourage farming and to raise farm incomes in these areas. The application of the measures provided for in this system should take into account the situation and development objectives particular to each region. Article 2 1. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the boundaries of the areas in which they propose to apply the special system of aids provided for in Article 4, and which, in the light of the characteristics specified in Article 3, are eligible for inclusion in the Community list of less-favoured farming areas. Member States shall at the same time submit all relevant information concerning the characteristics of these areas and the measures which they propose to apply in those areas under the special system of aids. 2. The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the Treaty, shall adopt the Community list of less-favoured farming areas within the meaning of Article 3 in which Member States are authorized to introduce the special system of aids provided for in Article 4. 3. However, at the request of a Member State, submitted in accordance with paragraph 1, amendments may be made to the limits of the areas in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18 of Directive No 72/159/EEC. These amendments may not have the effect of increasing the effective amount of agricultural land of all the areas in the Member States concerned by more than 0.5 % of the total affective agricultural area of that State. Article 3 1. The less-favoured farming areas shall include mountain areas, in which farming is necessary to protect the countryside, particularly for reasons of protection against erosion or in order to meet leisure needs ; they shall also include other areas where the maintenance of a minimum population or the conservation of the countryside are not assured. 2. These areas must have adequate infrastructures, including access roads to farms, electricity and drinking water and, in tourist and recreation areas, disposal of sewage. Should such amenities be lacking, their provision should be envisaged in the near future in public amenity programmes. 3. Mountain areas shall be made up of local government districts or parts thereof characterized by a considerable limitation of the possibilities for using the land and an appreciable increase in the cost of working it, due: - either to the existence, because of the altitude, of very difficult climatic conditions the effect of which is substantially to shorten the growing season, - or, at a lower altitude, to the presence, over the greater part of the district in question, of slopes too steep for the use of machinery or requiring the use of very expensive special equipment, - or to the combination of these two factors, where the handicap resulting from each taken separately is less acute, provided that this combination gives rise to a handicap equivalent to that caused by the situation referred to in the first two indents. 4. Less-favoured areas in danger of depopulation and where the conservation of the countryside is necessary, shall be made up of farming areas which are homogeneous from the point of view of natural production conditions and must simultaneously exhibit all the following characteristics: (a) the presence of infertile land, unsuitable for cultivation or intensification, with a limited potential which cannot be increased except at excessive cost, and mainly suitable for extensive livestock farming; (b) because of this low productivity of the environment, results which are appreciably lower than the mean as regards the main indices characterizing the economic situation in agriculture; (c) either a low or dwindling population predominantly dependent on agricultural activity, and the accelerated decline of which would jeopardize the viability of the area concerned and its continued habitation. 5. Less-favoured areas within the meaning of this Article may include : small areas affected by specific handicaps and in which farming must be continued in order to conserve the countryside and to preserve the tourist potential of the area or in order to protect the coastline. The total extent of such areas may not in any Member State exceed 2.5 % of the area of the State concerned. Article 4 1. The special system of aids referred to in Article 1 includes the following measures: - the granting, under the conditions laid down in Title II, of an allowance to compensate for permanent natural handicaps; - the granting, under the conditions laid down in Title III, of the aids referred to in Articles 8 and 10 of Directive No 72/159/EEC to farms suitable for development, - the granting of the aids to joint investment provided for in Article 11; - the granting, under the terms laid down in Article 12, of national aids to farms for the purpose of attaining the objectives set out in Article 1. 2. Member States shall be free to apply only some of the measures specified in paragraph 1. TITLE II Compensatory allowance Article 5 Member States may, within the limits and subject to the conditions laid down in Articles 6 and 7, grant an annual compensatory allowance for the permanent natural handicaps to assist farming activities specified in Article 3. The granting of such a compensatory allowance which exceeds those limits or which fails to satisfy those conditions, shall be prohibited in the areas appearing on the list adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 2 (2). Article 6 1. Where Member States grant a compensatory allowance, farmers with at least three hectares of utilized agricultural area who undertake to pursue a farming activity in accordance with the aims of this Directive for at least five years shall be eligible for such an allowance. However, where a farmer gives up agriculture in accordance with Article 2 (1) of Council Directive No 72/160/EEC (1) of 17 April 1972 concerning measures to encourage the cessation of farming and the reallocation of utilized agricultural areas for the purpose of structural improvement, in cases of force majeure or, for example where his property is subject to compulsory purchase or is purchased in the public interest, he shall be released from such undertaking. Farmers in receipt of a retirement pension shall be released from the undertaking referred to in the preceding paragraph. 2. Member States may lay down additional or restrictive conditions for granting the compensatory allowance. Article 7 1. Member States shall fix the amounts of the compensatory allowance according to the severity of the permanent natural handicaps affecting farming activities and having regard to the limits set out below. No allowance may be less than 15 units of account per livestock unit or, where appropriate, in the areas referred to in Article 3 (3), per hectare: (1)OJ No L 96, 23.4.1972, p. 9. (a) in the case of cattle, sheep and goats, the allowance shall be calculated in relation to livestock numbers. The allowance may not exceed 50 units of account per livestock unit. The total amount of the allowance granted may not exceed 50 units of account per hectare of the total forage area of the farm. A conversion table for expressing cattle, sheep and goats as livestock units appears in the Annex. Cows whose milk is intended for marketing may only be taken into consideration for the calculation of the compensatory allowance in the areas defined in Article 3 (3) and in the areas defined in Article 3 (4) and (5) where dairy products form an important part of farming activity. When Member States exercise this right in the areas defined in Article 3 (4) and (5), the compensatory allowance may not exceed 80 % of the unit amount of the compensatory allowance granted to other livestock units in the area, and the number of dairy cows per eligible farmer to be taken into consideration for the calculation of the compensatory allowance may not amount to more than 10 livestock units. (b) in the case of production other than of cattle, sheep and goats in the areas referred to in Article 3 (3), the allowance shall be calculated in relation to the area farmed, less the area required for feeding livestock, that given over to wheat growing and any area above 50 ares per farm comprising fully planted apple, pear or peach orchards. The allowance may not exceed 50 units of account per hectare. 2. Member States are entitled not to grant the compensatory allowance for some or all of the products which may benefit under the provisions of paragraph 1 (b). 3. Member States shall, when fixing rules for the implementation of this Article, provide themselves with the means of effectively controlling the bases for calculating the allowances paid to the recipients. TITLE III Special measures for farms suitable for development Article 8 Where Member States implement the measure laid down in the second indent of Article 4 (1), Articles 9 and 10 shall apply. Article 9 1. The minimum charge borne by the recipient of the incentives provided for in Article 8 of Directive No 72/159/EEC for farmers submitting development plans complying with Articles 2 and 4 of that Directive shall be reduced in relation to the minimum charge applied in the other regions. It may not, however, be less than 2 %. The interest rate subsidy, or the equivalent in the form of a capital grant or deferred repayment terms, shall be increased in relation to that applied in the other regions. It may not, however, exceed 7 %. 2. The amount of the guidance premium provided for in Article 10 of Directive No 72/159/EEC and the ceilings per farm laid down in Council Directive No 73/131/EEC (1) of 15 May 1973 on the guidance premium provided for in Article 10 of the Directive of 17 April 1972 on the modernization of farms, may be increased by one third. Such increase shall apply only to farms with more than 0.5 livestock units per hectare of forage area. 3. The recipient of a compensatory allowance paid under Article 5 may include the compensatory allowance in the level of earned income, within the meaning of Article 4 (1) of Directive No 72/159/EEC, to be attained upon completion of his development plan. Article 10 1. The system of incentives provided for in Articles 8 and 10 of Directive No 72/159/EEC, and adapted by Article 9 (1) and (2) of this Directive, shall also apply where the development plan does not satisfy the condition imposed by Article 4 (4) (b) of that Directive, which limits the percentage of income from non-agricultural activities to 20 % ; such percentage may not, however, exceed 50 %. Furthermore, as regards the areas referred to in Article 3 (3) the system of incentives laid down in Articles 8 and 10 of Directive No 72/159/EEC, and adapted by Article 9 (1) and (2) of this Directive, shall also apply when the development plan does not satisfy the conditions imposed by Article 4 (4) (b) of that Directive to the effect that the earned income from agricultural activities must correspond at least to the comparable earned income for one (1)OJ No L 153, 9.6.1973, p. 24. man-work unit ; in this case, however, the income from agricultural activities must equal at least 70 % of the comparable earned income for one man-work unit. 2. In less-favoured farming areas which are suitable for the development of a tourist or craft industry, the system of incentives provided for in Article 8 of Directive No 72/159/EEC, and adapted by Article 9 (1) of this Directive, may also be applied to investment on farms, for tourist or craft industry purposes, of a total amount not exceeding 10 000 units of account per farm. TITLE IV Other measures to aid investment Article 11 Member States may grant aids to joint investment schemes for fodder production and to improvement and equipment schemes for pasture and hill grazing land which is farmed jointly. Article 12 1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 14 of Directive No 72/159/EEC other than those of paragraph 2 (b), Member States may grant investment aids to farms which are not capable of attaining the level of earned income laid down under Article 4 of that Directive, as adapted by Articles 9 (3) and 10 (1) of this Directive. 2. The aids referred to in paragraph 1 may not be granted on conditions more favourable than those granted by the Member State outside the areas specified in Article 3 to farms fulfilling the conditions of Articles 2 and 4 of Directive No 72/159/EEC. However, the selective character of the modernization incentive within the areas specified in Article 3 must be ensured. In the case of investments for land improvement, aid may not be granted on conditions more favourable than those granted by the Member State in respect of investments having the same aim, to farms in the same area fulfilling the conditions of Articles 2 and 4 of Directive No 72/159/EEC, as adapted by Articles 9 (3) and 10 (1) of this Directive. 3. When a Member State applies the system of aids referred to in paragraph 1 in a less favoured area, it must apply the provisions of Article 9 (1). TITLE V Financial and general provisions Article 13 The series of measures provided for by this Directive forms part of the common measures according to Article 15 of Directive No 72/159/EEC, the financial and general provisions of which apply to this Directive, taking into account the following provisions. Article 14 The estimated total cost of the common measures referred to in Article 15 of Directive No 72/159/EEC shall be increased to 254.4 million units of account for the first three years. Article 15 Expenditure by Member States in respect of measures taken under Articles 5 to 11 shall be eligible for assistance from the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, as provided for in Article 19 of Directive No 72/159/EEC. The Guidance Section of the EAGGF shall reimburse to Member States 25 % of eligible expenditure for the compensatory allowance referred to under Title II. However, this expenditure shall not be eligible for reimbursement where the farmer receives a retirement pension. The Community contribution towards eligible expenditure for the aid provided for in Article 11 may not exceed 20 000 units of account per joint investment scheme and 100 units of account per hectare of pasture or mountain land improved or provided with equipment. Article 16 1. The authorization referred to in Article 1 shall take effect from 1 October 1974. 2. However, the financial contribution of the Community towards eligible expenditure for aids provided for under Articles 5 and 11 shall only be incurred for the aids granted during 1975 and thereafter. Article 17 Member States shall take the necessary measures to conform to the provisions of this Directive within one year from the date of its notification.

Title II - Rules applicable to undertakings whose head offices are situated within the Community Section A : Conditions of admission Article 6 1.

It shall, furthermore, be required to show proof that it possesses the solvency margin provided for in Article 16 and, if, with regard to such other classes, the provisions of Article 17 (2) require a higher minimum guarantee fund than previously, that it possesses such minimum. 3. These coordinating measures do not prevent Member States from applying provisions requiring directors and managers to have technical qualifications or from requiring the memorandum or articles of association, general and special policy conditions, tariffs and any other documents necessary for the normal exercise of supervision to be approved. 4. The abovementioned provisions may not require that any application for an authorization shall be dealt with in the light of the economic requirements of the market. Article 9 The scheme of operations referred to in Article 8 (1) (c) shall contain the following particulars or proof concerning: (a) The nature of the risks which the undertaking proposes to cover ; the general and special policy conditions which it proposes to use; (b) The tariffs which it is proposed to apply for each category of business; (c) The guiding principles as to reinsurance; (d) The items constituting the minimum guarantee fund; (e) Estimates relating to the expenses of installing the administrative services and the organization for securing business ; the financial resources intended to cover them; and in addition, for the first three financial years: (f) Estimates relating to expenses of management other than costs of installation, and in particular current general expenses and Commissions; (g) Estimates relating to premiums or contributions and to claims; (h) A forecast balance sheet; (i) Estimates relating to the financial resources intended to cover underwriting liabilities and the solvency margin.

The designated agent shall not be refused by the Member State except on grounds relating to repute or technical qualifications such as apply to directors of undertakings whose head offices are situated in the territory of the State in question. With regard to Lloyd's, in the event of any litigation in the host country resulting from underwritten commitments, assured persons must not be more unfavourably treated than if the litigation had been brought against businesses of a more conventional type. The authorized agent must, therefore, possess sufficient powers to enable proceedings to be instituted against him and must in that capacity be able to bind the Lloyd's underwriters concerned. 2. Each Member State shall require that for the purpose of extending the business of the agency or branch, either to other classes or to other parts of the national territory in the case provided for in Article 6 (2) (d), the applicant for the authorization shall submit a scheme of operations in accordance with Article 11 and comply with the conditions contained in (1) (b) above. 3. These coordinating measures do not prevent Member States from enforcing provisions requiring, for all insurance undertakings, approval of the general and special policy conditions, tariffs and any other document necessary for the normal exercise of supervision. 4. The abovementioned provisions may not require that any application for an authorization shall be examined in the light of the economic requirements of the market. Article 11 1. The scheme of operations of the agency or branch referred to in Article 10 (1) (c) shall contain the following particulars or proofs concerning: (a) The nature of the risks which the undertaking proposes to cover in the host country ; the general and special policy conditions which it proposes to use; (b) The tariffs which the undertaking proposes to apply for each category of business; (c) The guiding principles as to reinsurance; (d) The state of the solvency margin of the undertaking, referred to in Articles 16 and 17; (e) Estimates relating to the expenses of installing the administrative services and the organization for securing business ; the financial resources intended to cover them; and in addition, for the first three financial years: (f) Estimates relating to expenses of management; (g) Estimates relating to premiums or contributions and to claims in respect of the new business; (h) A forecast balance sheet for the agency or branch. However, the particulars referred to in (a) and (b) above shall not be required with regard to the risks classified under Nos 4, 5, 6, 7 and 12 of point A of the Annex, nor shall those referred to in (b) above be required with regard to the risks classified under Nos 14 and 15 of point A of the Annex. The particulars referred to in (a) and (b) need not be required in the case of risks classified under No 11 of the same point. 2. The scheme of operations shall be accompanied by the balance sheet and profit and loss account of the undertaking for each of the past three financial years. If, however, it has not yet been in business for three financial years it shall be required to furnish them only for the financial years completed. With regard to Lloyd's, the publication of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account shall be replaced by the compulsory presentation of annual trading accounts covering the insurance operations, and accompanied by an affidavit certifying that auditors'certificates have been supplied in respect of each insurer and showing that the responsibilities incurred as a result of these operations are wholly covered by the assets. These documents must allow authorities to form a view of the state of solvency of the Association. 3. The scheme of operations, together with the observations of the authorities competent to issue authorizations, shall be forwarded to the competent authorities of the head office country. The latter authorities shall communicate their Opinion to the former within three months from the receipt of the documents ; if their Opinion has not been communicated upon the expiry of this time, it shall he deemed to he favourable. Article 12 Any decision to refuse an authorization shall be accompanied by the precise grounds for doing so and notified to the undertaking in question. Each Member State shall make provision for a right to apply to the courts should there be any refusal. Such provision shall also be made with regard to cases where to competent authorities have not dealt with an application for an authorization upon the expiry of a period of six months from the date of its receipt. Section B : Conditions for exercise of business Article 13 Member States shall collaborate closely with one another in supervising the financial position of authorized undertakings. Article 14 The supervisory authority of the Member State in whose territory the head office of the undertaking is situated must verify the state of solvency of the undertaking with respect to its entire business. The supervisory authorities of the other Member States shall provide the former with all the information necessary to enable such verification to be effected. Article 15 1. Each Member State in whose territory business is carried on shall require the undertaking to establish sufficient technical reserves. The amount of such reserves shall be determined according to the rules fixed by the State, or, in the absence of such rules, according to the established practices in such State. 2. Technical reserves shall be required to be covered by equivalent and matching assets localized in each country where business is carried on. Member States may, however, permit relaxations in the rules as to matching assets and the localization of assets. Having regard to its special position, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may, pending coordination of legislation on the winding-up of undertakings, retain the system of guarantees for technical reserves existing at the time of entry into force of this Directive. The regulations of the country where the business is is carried on shall determine the nature of such assets and, where appropriate, the extent to which they may be used for the purpose of covering the technical reserves and shall also determine the rules for valuing such assets. 3. If a Member State allows any technical reserves to be covered by claims against reinsurers, it shall fix the percentage so allowed. In such case, it may not require the assets representing such claims to be localized in its territory, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2. 4. The supervisory authority of the Member State in whose territory the head office of an undertaking is situated shall verify that its balance sheet shows in respect of the technical reserves assets equivalent to the underwriting liabilities assumed in all the countries where it undertakes business. Article 16 1. Each Member State shall require every undertaking whose head office is situated in its territory to establish an adequate solvency margin in respect of its entire business. The solvency margin shall correspond to the assets of the undertaking, free of all foreseeable liabilities, less any intangible items. In particular the following shall be considered: - the paid up share capital or, in the case of a mutual concern, the effective initial fund, - one-half of the share capital or the initial fund which is not yet paid up, once the paid-up part reaches 25 % of this capital or fund, - reserves (statutory reserves and free reserves) not corresponding to underwriting liabilities, - any carry-forward of profits, - in the case of a mutual or mutual-type association with variable contributions, any claim which it has against its members by way of a call for supplementary contribution, within the financial year, up to one-half of the difference between the maximum contributions and the contributions actually called in, and subject to an over-riding limit of 50 % of the margin, - at the request of, and upon proof being shown by the undertaking, and with the agreement of the supervisory authorities of each other Member State where it carries on its business, any hidden reserves resulting from under-estimation of assets or over-estimation of liabilities in the balance sheet, in so far as such hidden reserves are not of an exceptional nature. Over-estimation of technical reserves shall be determined in relation to their amount calculated by the undertaking in conformity to national regulations ; however, pending further coordination of technical reserves, an amount equivalent to 75 % of the difference between the amount of the reserve for outstanding risks calculated at a flat rate by the undertaking by application of a minimum percentage in relation to premiums and the amount that would have been obtained by calculating the reserve contract by contract where the national law gives an option between the two methods, can be taken into account in the solvency margin up to 20 %. 2. The solvency margin shall be determined on the basis either of the annual amount of premiums or contributions, or of the average burden of claims for the past three financial years. In the case, however, of undertakings which essentially underwrite only one or more of the risks of storm, hail, frost, the last seven years shall be taken as the period of reference for the average burden of claims. 3. Subject to the provisions of Article 17, the amount of the solvency margin shall be equal to the higher of the following two results: first result (premium basis): - the premiums or contributions (inclusive of charges ancillary to premiums or contributions) due in respect of all direct business in the last financial year for all financial years, shall be aggregated, - to this aggregate there shall be added the amount of premiums accepted for all reinsurance in the last financial year, - from this sum there shall then be deducted the total amount of premiums or contributions cancelled in the last financial year, as well as the total amount of taxes and levies pertaining to the premiums or contributions entering into the aggregate. The amount so obtained shall be divided into two portions, the first portion extending up to 10 million units of account, the second comprising the excess ; 18 % and 16 % of these portions respectively shall be calculated and added together. The first result shall be obtained by multiplying the sum so calculated by the ratio existing in respect of the last financial year between the amount of claims remaining to be borne by the undertaking after deduction of transfers for reinsurance and the gross amount of claims ; this ratio may in no case be less than 50 %. Second result (claims basis): - the amounts of claims paid in respect of direct business (without any deduction of claims borne by reinsurers and retrocessionaires) in the periods specified in (2) shall be aggregated, - to this aggregate there shall be added the amount of claims paid in respect of reinsurances or retrocessions accepted during the same periods, - to this sum there shall be added the amount of provisions or reserves for outstanding claims established at the end of the last financial year both for direct business and for reinsurance acceptances, - from this sum there shall be deducted the amount of claims paid during the periods specified in (2), - from the sum then remaining, there shall be deducted the amount of provisions or reserves for outstanding claims established at the commencement of the second financial year preceding the last financial year for which there are accounts, both for direct business and for reinsurance acceptances. One-third, or one-seventh, of the amount so obtained, according to the period of reference established in (2), shall be divided into two portions, the first extending up to seven million units of account and the second comprising the excess ; 26 % and 23 % of these portions respectively shall be calculated and added together. The second result shall be obtained by multiplying the sum so obtained by the ratio existing in respect of the last financial year between the amount of claims remaining to be borne by the business after transfers for reinsurance and the gross amount of claims ; this ratio may in no case be less than 50 %. 4. The fractions applicable to the portions referred to in (3) shall each be reduced to a third in the case of health insurance practised on a similar technical basis to that of life assurance, if - the premiums paid are calculated on the basis of sickness tables according to the mathematical method applied in insurance, - a reserve is set up for increasing age, - an additional premium is collected in order to set up a safety margin of an appropriate amount, - the insurer may only cancel the contract before the end of the third year of insurance at the latest, - the contract provides for the possibility of increasing premiums or reducing payments even for current contracts. 5. In the case of Lloyd's, the calculation of the first result in respect of premiums, referred to in paragraph 3, shall be made on the basis of net premiums, which shall be multiplied by a flat-rate percentage fixed annually by the internal auditor. This flat-rate percentage must be calculated on the basis of the most recent statistical data on Commissions paid. The details, together with the relevant calculations shall be sent to the authorities of the countries where Lloyd's is established. Article 17 1. One-third of the solvency margin shall constitute the guarantee fund. 2. (a) The guarantee fund may not, however, be less than: - 400 000 units of account in the case where all or some of the risks included in one of the classes listed in point A of the Annex under Nos 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are covered, - 300 000 units of account in the case where all or some of the risks included in one of the classes listed in point A of the Annex under Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 16 are covered, - 200 000 units of account in the case where all or some of the risks included in one of the classes listed in point A of the Annex under Nos 9 and 17 are covered; (b) If the business carried on by the undertaking covers several classes or several risks, only that class or risk for which the highest amount is required shall be taken into account; (c) Any Member State may provide for a one-fourth reduction of the minimum guarantee fund in the case of mutual associations and mutual-type associations. Article 18 1. Member States shall not prescribe any rules as to the choice of the assets in excess of those representing the technical reserves referred to in Article 15. 2. Subject to the provisions of Article 15 (2), Article 20 (1) and (3) and Article 22 (1) last subparagraph, Member States shall not restrain the free disposal of the assets, whether movable or immovable property, forming part of the assets of authorized businesses. The Federal Republic of Germany may, however, pending further coordination of the conditions for the taking up and pursuit of the business of life assurance maintain, with respect to health insurance within the meaning of Article 16 (4), the restrictions imposed on the free disposal of assets in so far as the free disposal of assets which cover mathematical reserves is subject to the agreement of a ""TreuhÃ ¤nder"". Until further measures of coordination have been taken, the Kingdom of Denmark may however retain in force its legislation restricting the free disposal of assets built up by insurance undertakings to cover pensions payable under compulsory insurance against industrial accidents. 3. These provisions shall not preclude any measures which Member States, while observing the rules prevailing in the country where the business is carried on, as required under Article 15 (2), and while safeguarding the interests of the insured, are entitled to take as owners or members or associates of the undertakings in question. Article 19 1. Each Member State shall require every undertaking whose head office is situated in its territory to produce an annual account covering all types of operation, of its financial situation and solvency. 2. Member States shall require undertakings operating in their territory to render periodically the returns, together with statistical documents, which are necessary for the purposes of supervision. The competent supervisory authorities shall furnish each other with the documents and information necessary for exercising supervision. Article 20 1. If an undertaking does not comply with the provisions of Article 15, the supervisory authority of the country where it carries on its business may prohibit the free disposal of assets in that country after having informed the supervisory authorities of the country where the head office is situated of its intention. 2. For the purposes of restoring the financial situation of an undertaking whose solvency margin has fallen below the minimum required under Article 16 (3), the supervisory authority of the head-office country shall require a plan for the restoration of a sound financial position to be submitted for its approval. 3. If the solvency margin falls below the guarantee fund as defined in Article 17, the supervisory authority of the head-office country shall require the undertaking to submit a short-term finance scheme for its approval. It may also restrict or prohibit the free disposal of the assets of the undertaking. It shall inform the authorities of other Member States in whose territories the undertaking is authorized of any measures and the latter shall, at the request of the former, take the same measures. 4. The competent supervisory authorities may further take all measures necessary to safeguard the interests of the insured in the cases provided for in (1) and (3). 5. The supervisory authorities of other Member States in whose territory the undertaking in question has also been authorized shall collaborate for the purpose of implementing the provisions referred to in (1) to (4). Article 21 1. Each Member State shall make it possible for an undertaking to assign all or part of its portfolio of policies if the assignees possess the necessary solvency margin, due account being taken of the assignment. The supervisory authorities concerned shall consult each other before approving such assignment. 2. Once approved by the competent supervisory authority, such assignment shall affect directly the policy-holders or insured concerned. Section C : Withdrawal of authorization Article 22 1. The authorization granted by the competent authority of the Member State in whose territory the head office is situated may be withdrawn by such authority if the undertaking: (a) No longer fulfils the conditions of admission; (b) Has been unable, within the time allowed, to take the measures contained in the restoration plan or finance scheme referred to in Article 20; (c) Fails seriously in its obligations under the national regulations. In the event of the withdrawal of the authorization, the supervisory authority of the head-office country shall notify such withdrawal to the supervisory authorities of other Member States which have issued an authorization to the undertaking ; they shall, thereupon, also withdraw their authorizations. The supervisory authority of the head-office country shall, in conjunction with such other authorities, take all necessary measures to safeguard the interests of the insured and, in particular, shall restrict the free disposal of the assets of the undertaking if such restriction has not been already imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 (1) and (3), subparagraph 2. 2. An authorization granted to an agency or branch of an undertaking whose head office is situated in another Member State may be withdrawn if the agency or branch: (a) No longer fulfils the conditions for admission; (b) Fails seriously in its obligations under the regulations of the country where it carries on its business, with respect in particular to the establishment of technical reserves as defined in Article 15. Before withdrawing the authorization the supervisory authorities of the country where business is carried on shall consult the supervisory authority of the country where the head office is situated. If they deem it necessary to suspend the business of such agency or branch before consultation is concluded, they shall immediately advise the supervisory authority of the country where the head office is situated. 3. Any decision to withdraw an authorization or suspend business shall be supported by precise reasons and notified to the undertaking in question. Each Member State shall make provision for a right to apply to the courts against such a decision. Title III - Rules applicable to agencies or branches established within the Community and belonging to undertakings whose head offices are outside the Community Article 23 1.

Article 24 Member States shall require undertakings to establish adequate technical reserves to cover the underwriting liabilities assumed in their territories. Member States shall see that the agency or branch covers such technical reserves by means of assets which are equivalent to such reserves and are, to the extent fixed by the State in question, matching assets. The law of the Member States shall be applicable to the calculation of technical reserves, the determination of categories of investments, and the valuation of assets. The Member State in question shall require that the assets representing the technical reserves shall be localized in its territory. Article 15 (3) shall, however, be applicable. Article 25 1. Each Member State shall require for agencies or branches established in its territory a solvency margin consisting of assets free of all foreseeable liabilities, less any intangible items. The solvency margin shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 (3). However, for the purpose of calculating this margin, account shall be taken only of the premiums or contributions and claims pertaining to the business effected by the agency or branch concerned. 2. One-third of the solvency margin shall constitute the guarantee fund. The guarantee fund may not be less than one-half of the minimum required under Article 17 (2). The initial deposit lodged in accordance with Article 23 (2) (e) shall be counted towards such guarantee fund. 3. The assets representing the solvency margin must be kept within the country where the business is carried on up to the amount of the guarantee fund and the excess, within the Community. Article 26 1. Any undertaking which, having obtained an authorization from one Member State, obtains an authorization from one or more other Member States to establish other agencies or branches therein may apply for one or more of the following advantages: (a) That the solvency margin referred to in Article 25 be calculated in relation to the entire business which it undertakes within the Community ; in such case, account shall be taken of the premiums or contributions and claims pertaining to the business effected by all the agencies or branches established within the Community; (b) That it be dispensed from lodging the deposit required under Article 23 (2) (e), in such States also; (c) That the assets representing the guarantee fund be kept in any one of the Member States in which it carries out business. 2.

However, at the request of the undertaking and with the unanimous approval of the Member States concerned, such verification may be carried out by the competent authority of another Member State. The authority carrying out the verification shall obtain from the other Member States the necessary information regarding the agencies or branches established in their territories. 3. The advantages conferred by this Article may be withdrawn upon the initiative of one or more of the Member States concerned. Article 27 The provisions of Articles 19 and 20 shall also apply in relation to agencies and branches of undertakings to which this Title applies.

Article 29 The Community may, by means of agreements concluded pursuant to the Treaty with one or more third countries, agree to the application of provisions different to those provided for in this Title, for the purpose of ensuring, under conditions of reciprocity, adequate protection for insured persons in the Member States.

It shall notify the other Member States and the Commission of the measures taken; (b) certain types of vehicle or certain vehicles having a special plate ; the list of such types or of such vehicles shall be drawn up by the State concerned and communicated to the other Member States and to the Commission.

Article 5 Each Member State shall ensure that, where an accident is caused in its territory by a vehicle normally based in the territory of another Member State, the national insurers' bureau shall, without prejudice to the obligation referred to in the first indent of Article 2 (2), obtain information: - as to the territory in which the vehicle is normally based, and as to its registration mark, if any; - in so far as is possible, as to the details of the insurance of the vehicle, as they normally appear on the green card, which are in the possession of the person having custody of the vehicle, to the extent that these details are required by the Member State in whose territory the vehicle is normally based. Each Member State shall also ensure that the bureau communicates this information to the national insurers' bureau of the State in whose territory the vehicle is normally based. Article 6 Each Member State shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that vehicles normally based in the territory of a third country or in the non-European territory of a Member State entering the territory in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is in force shall not be used in its territory unless any loss or injury caused by those vehicles is covered, in accordance with the requirements of the laws of the various Member States on compulsory insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of vehicles, throughout the territory in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is in force. Article 7 1. Every vehicle normally based in the territory of a third country or in the non-European territory of a Member State must, before entering the territory in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is in force, be provided either with a valid green card or with a certificate of frontier insurance establishing that the vehicle is insured in accordance with Article 6. 2. However, vehicles normally based in a third country shall be treated as vehicles normally based in the Community if the national bureaux of all the Member States severally guarantee, each in accordance with the provisions of its own national law on compulsory insurance, settlement of claims in respect of accidents occurring in their territory caused by such vehicles. 3. Upon having ascertained, in close cooperation with the Member States, that the obligations referred to in the preceding paragraph have been assumed, the Commission shall fix the date from which and the types of vehicles for which Member States shall no longer require production of the documents referred to in paragraph 1.

"71","31972L0159","Article 1 of the Council Decision of 4 December 1962 on the coordination of policies on agricultural structure, 3 and involving, as regards financial aspects, consultation with the EAGGF Committee referred to in Articles 11 to 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70; Whereas it is desirable that the European Parliament and the Council be able, on the basis of a report submitted by the Commission, to examine annually the effects of the national and Community measures taken, so that they may assess the need to supplement or adapt the system introduced hereunder; HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: TITLE I Incentives to farms suitable for development Article 1 1. With a view to bringing about structural conditions conducive to a significant improvement in 1OJ No L 96, 17.4.1972, p. 9. 2OJ No L 94, 28.4.1970, p. 13. 3OJ No 136, 17.12.1962, p. 2892/62. agricultural incomes and working and production conditions, Member States shall introduce a system of selective incentives to farms suitable for development, designed to encourage their operation and development under rational conditions. 2. Member States may, acting in accordance with the general provisions to be adopted hereafter by the Council under the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the Treaty: - vary according to region the amount of the financial incentives provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 8 (2), and, within the limits set out therein, those provided for in Articles 10, 11 and 12 and also those provided for in Article 13; - refrain from applying in certain regions all or some of the measures provided for in Articles 8, 10, 11, 12 and 13. Article 2 For the purposes of this Directive a farm shall be considered suitable for development where: 1. the farmer: (a) practises farming as his main occupation; (b) possesses adequate occupational skill and competence; (c) undertakes that from the start of the development plan he will keep accounts as defined in Article 11; (d) draws up a plan for the development of the farm business which satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 4; 2. its level of earned income is below that fixed in Article 4 (1) as the modernization objective, or where its present structure is such as to jeopardize the maintenance of that income at a comparable level ; in the latter case, the interest rate subsidy provided for in Article 8 (1) (b) shall apply only to 80 % of the loan referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article. Article 3 1. Member States shall for the purposes of this Directive define what is meant by the expression ""a farmer practising farming as his main occupation"". Definitions shall, in the case of a natural person, at least include the condition that the proportion of income from farming be not less than 50 % of the farmer's total income and that the working time devoted to non-farming activities be less than half of the farmer's total working time. Having regard, in particular, to the criteria indicated in the preceding subparagraph, Member States shall define the aforesaid expression: - in relation to a person other than a natural person; - in respect of a farm owned by a person other than the farmer; - in respect of a farm worked under a share-cropping agreement. 2. In addition, Member States shall lay down the criteria for assessing the occupational skill and competence of the farmer. Such criteria shall refer to the standard of agricultural training received or to a minimum period of farming experience or to both. Article 4 1. The development plan provided for in Article 2 (1) (d) must show that, upon its completion, the farm undergoing modernization will be capable of attaining as a minimum, in principle for either one or two man-work units, a level of earned income comparable to that received for non-agricultural work in the region in question. 2. A comparable earned income as referred to in paragraph 1 means the average gross wage for a non-agricultural worker. Member States may, where necessary, take account of disparities between the social security arrangements for farmers and those for non-agricultural workers. 3. For the purpose of showing that the farm undergoing modernization will be capable of attaining the objective referred to in paragraph 1, the earned income to be attained upon completion of the development plan shall be compared either: - with the comparable earned income as defined in paragraph 2, or - with that of reference farms which at the time when application is made have an earned income equivalent to the comparable income as defined in paragraph 2. 4. Member States (a) shall: - specify the minimum number of man-work units, having regard to the various types of production and to the working conditions associated therewith; - determine what constitutes an adequate return on the capital invested in the farm business; - fix, having regard to the duration of the development plan, the modernization objective referred to in paragraph 1; (b) may provide that up to a specified percentage of the earned income to be attained upon completion of the development plan may consist of income arising from non-agricultural activities, so long as the earned income derived from the farm business is at least equal to the comparable earned income for one man-work unit. The percentage specified may not exceed 20 %. 5. Upon completion of the plan, the level of income referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 must be attainable by means of an annual working period not exceeding 2300 hours. 6. The achievement of the objectives of the development plan may be spread over a maximum of six years. However, Member States may be authorized, under the procedure laid down in Article 18, to specify a longer period for certain regions. Article 5 1. Persons coming within Articles 2 and 3 who wish to benefit from the incentives herein provided for shall submit applications to the authorities appointed under Article 7. 2. An application may be made by a single farmer or by several farmers who are in association or who have agreed to form an association. Member States shall not discriminate between single and associated farmers. Article 6 1. The application shall be accompanied by the development plan provided for in Article 2 (1) (d). This shall contain all the necessary particulars for assessing whether the farm satisfies the conditions laid down in Articles 2 and 4, and in particular: - a description of the situation at the start of the plan; - a description, in the form of a forward estimate, of the situation on completion of the plan; - an indication of the measures to be taken, and in particular of the investments to be made, in order to achieve the desired results. 2. If the development plan contains a proposal for extending the area of the farm, the enlarged area shall consist of: - the land already in the possession of the farmer; - land in respect of which he has been given a legally enforceable promise entitling him to possession. Article 7 Member States shall: - appoint the authorities responsible for examining applications and approving development plans; - lay down an examination and approval procedure. Article 8 1. Incentives to farmers whose applications have been accepted and whose development plans have been approved shall include the following measures: (a) the allocation, by way of priority, of land released under the Council Directive of 17 April 1972; (b) the granting of aids in the form of interest rate subsidies in respect of the investments necessary for carrying out the development plan, but excluding expenditure incurred in buying: - land; - pigs, poultry, or calves intended for slaughter. With regard to the purchase of livestock, only the initial purchase provided for by the development plan may be taken into account; (c) the provision of guarantees for loans contracted and the interest thereon, where the security or personal guarantee provided is insufficient. 2. The interest rate subsidy provided for in paragraph 1 (b) shall apply to the whole of the loan, except for any part of the loan exceeding 40 000 units of account per man-work unit. It shall not exceed 5 % and, in principle, shall cover a period of fifteen years, which Member States may, however, extend to twenty years for investments in immovable property and reduce to ten years for other investments. The rate of interest remaining payable by the beneficiary may not be lower than 3 %. Member States may grant this aid, in whole or in part, in the form of a capital subsidy or of deferred repayments ; or they may combine the two forms. However, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission and voting as provided in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty, may authorize a Member State, for a specified period: - to grant interest rate subsidies exceeding 5 %, if such action is warranted by the situation of the capital market in that Member State; - to lower the minimum rate payable by the beneficiary to 2 % in certain regions. Article 9 1. Where the development plan provides for the purchase of cattle or sheep, the granting for the purchase of such livestock of the aids provided for in Article 8 (1) (b) and (c) shall be subject to the condition that the proportion of sales from the cattle and sheep enterprises on completion of the development plan will be greater than 60 % of the total sales of the business. 2. Where the development plan provides for an investment in pig farming, the granting under Article 8 (1) (b) or (c) of the incentives to that investment shall be subject to the condition that the investment is of at least 10 000 units of account but does not exceed 40 000 units of account and that the farm will be capable on completion of the plan of producing at least 35 % of the feedingstuffs consumed by the pigs. In the case of joint production by more than one farm, this condition shall be satisfied if any one or more of the farms involved is capable of producing 35 % of the feedingstuffs. 3. In respect of poultry and eggs the granting of the incentives provided for in Article 8 (1) (b) and (c) shall be subject to a subsequent decision by the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission and voting as provided in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty. Article 10 Where it is provided in the development plan that the farm will concentrate on the production of beef, veal, mutton or lamb, the incentives provided for in Article 8 shall be supplemented by the granting of a guidance premium. The amount of this premium shall be fixed before 15 September 1972 by the Council, acting upon a proposal from the Commission and voting as provided in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty. TITLE II Other measures to assist farms Article 11 1. Member States shall introduce a system of incentives to encourage the keeping of accounts on farms. Where in a Member State more than 70 % of farms operated by way of main occupation already keep accounts satisfying the provisions of paragraph 2, that Member State shall not be obliged to introduce such a system. The system shall involve granting to farmers whose main occupation is farming and who apply therefor and aid of 450 units of account, spread over at least the first four years during which management accounts are kept on their farms. 2. The keeping of accounts shall: (a) comprise: - the preparation of annual opening and closing valuations; - the systematic and regular recording over the accounting year of the various transactions in cash or in kind concerning the farm business; (b) conclude with the presentation each year of: - a description of the general characteristics of the farm business, and in particular of the factors of production employed; - a detailed balance sheet (assets and liabilities) and trading account (expenditure and income); - the necessary data, including in particular the earned income per man-work unit and the farmer's income, for assessing the efficiency of the management of the farm business as a whole and the profitability of the main enterprises of the business. 3. Where a farm is chosen by the authorities appointed by Member States for the collection of accountancy data for purposes of information and scientific study, in particular within the framework of the EEC accountancy data network, and the farmer is in receipt of aid as provided for in paragraph 1, he must undertake to make available to those authorities, under conditions of anonymity, the accountancy data relating to his farm. Article 12 Member States shall on request grant to any recognized group having as its object mutual aid between farms, a more rational common use of agricultural investments, or group farming operations, a launching aid as a contribution to management costs. The amount of such aid shall be not less than 2500 units of account and not more than 7500 units of account and shall be fixed according to the number of participants and to the work carried out jointly. The legal form which such groups shall take and the provisions governing cooperation between members shall be determined by Member States. Article 13 1. With a view to promoting the modernization of farms coming within Article 2, through schemes for irrigation or for land reparcelling and works related thereto, Member States shall: - introduce special systems of national aids, comprising additional incentives to promote modernization of farms coming within Articles 2 and 4 and to encourage the cessation of farming ; or - adapt their existing systems of aids for general structural improvement in such a way as to encourage land reparcelling and irrigation schemes fulfilling the condition laid down in paragraph 2. 2. The Community shall contribute to the expenditure incurred by Member States for land reparcelling and works related thereto, and for irrigation, including any additional incentives introduced under the first indent of paragraph 1, provided that after completion of the land reallocation or irrigation scheme at least 40 % of the utilized agricultural area is to be worked by farms whose development plans have been approved, or that 70 % thereof is to be worked by farms which have reached the level of development laid down in Article 4 (1). Article 14 1. Aids for investments on farms satisfying the conditions laid down in Articles 2 and 4 which exceed the amount laid down in Article 8 (2) shall be prohibited, with the exception of aids: - for the construction of farm buildings; - for the transfer of farm buildings to new sites, where this is done in the public interest; - for land improvement operations; these exceptions being subject to paragraph 3 of this Article and to Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty. 2. As regards investments on other farms and without prejudice to Article 92 (2) of the Treaty, Member States may grant aids only in so far as the interest remaining payable by the beneficiary, or the equivalent of that interest if the aid is given in another form, amounts to not less than 5 % per year. However: (a) Member States may, during a period of five years from the time when this Directive takes effect, grant temporary aids to farmers who are not capable of attaining the level of earned income laid down under Article 4 and who are not yet eligible for the annuities provided for in Article 2 (1) of the Council Directive of 17 April 1972 concerning measures to encourage the cessation of farming and the reallocation of utilized agricultural area for the purposes of structural improvement, but such aids may not be granted on more favourable terms than those laid down in Article 8 hereof; (b) Member States may introduce systems of special aids in certain regions where the maintenance of a minimum level of population is not assured and where a minimum amount of farming is essential in view of the need to conserve the countryside; The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the Treaty, shall lay down the criteria to be used in defining such regions and in applying such systems. 3. The following shall also be prohibited: (a) aids for the purchase of pigs, poultry, or calves for slaughter; (b) aids which do not satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 9.

In order to enable the Council to determine the common rates for capital duty before the end of the transitional period, the Commission shall submit a proposal to the Council on this subject before 1 January 1971. 3. In the case of an increase in a company's capital in accordance with Article 4 (1) (c), following a reduction in the company's capital as a result of losses sustained, the rate may be reduced for that part of the increase which corresponds to the reduction in capital, if this increase occurs within four years of the reduction in capital. 4.

Article 8 A Member State may partially or totally exempt from capital duty the transactions referred to in Article 4 (1) and (2) relating to: - capital companies which supply public services, such as public transport undertakings, port authorities or undertakings supplying water, gas or electricity, in cases where the State or regional or local authorities own at least half of the company's capital; - capital companies which, in accordance with their regulations and in fact, pursue exclusively and directly cultural, charitable, relief or educational objectives.

The Member State which proposes to take such a measure shall refer the matter to the Commission in good time, having regard to the application of Article 102 of the Treaty. Article 10 Apart from capital duty, Member States shall not charge, with regard to companies, firms, associations or legal persons operating for profit, any taxes whatsoever: (a) in respect of the transactions referred to in Article 4; (b) in respect of contributions, loans or the provision of services, occurring as part of the transactions referred to in Article 4; (c) in respect of registration or any other formality required before the commencement of business to which a company, firm, association or legal person operating for profit may be subject by reason of its legal form.

Article 13 Member States shall bring into force by 1 January 1972 such provisions by way of law, regulation or administrative action as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of this Directive and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. Article 14 Member States shall ensure that the texts of the main provisions of internal law which they subsequently adopt in the field covered by this Directive are forwarded to the Commission.

Copies supplied shall be certified as ""true copies"", unless the applicant dispenses with such certification. 4. Disclosure of the documents and particulars referred to in paragraph 2 shall be effected by publication in the national gazette appointed for that purpose by the Member State, either of the full or partial text, or by means of a reference to the document which has been deposited in the file or entered in the register. 5. The documents and particulars may be relied on by the company as against third parties only after they have been published in accordance with paragraph 4, unless the company proves that the third parties had knowledge thereof. However, with regard to transactions taking place before the sixteenth day following the publication, the documents and particulars shall not be relied on as against third parties who prove that it was impossible for them to have had knowledge thereof. 6. Member States shall take the necessary measures to avoid any discrepancy between what is disclosed by publication in the press and what appears in the register or file. However, in cases of discrepancy, the text published in the press may not be relied on as against third parties; the latter may nevertheless rely thereon, unless the company proves that they had knowledge of the texts deposited in the file or entered in the register. 7. Third parties may, moreover, always rely on any documents and particulars in respect of which the disclosure formalities have not yet been completed, save where non-disclosure causes them not to have effect. Article 4 Member States shall prescribe that letters and order forms shall state the following particulars: - the register in which the file mentioned in Article 3 is kept, together with the number of the company in that register; - the legal form of the company, the location of its scat and, where appropriate, the fact that the company is being wound up. Where in these documents mention is made of the capital of the company, the reference shall be to the capital subscribed and paid up. Article 5 Each Member State shall determine by which persons the disclosure formalities are to be carried out. Article 6 Member States shall provide for appropriate penalties in case of: - failure to disclose the balance sheet and profit and loss account as required by Article 2 (1) (f); - omission from commercial documents of the compulsory particulars provided for in Article 4. SECTION II Validity of obligations entered into by a company Article 7 If, before a company being formed has acquired legal personality, action has been carried out in its name and the company does not assume the obligations arising from such action, the persons who acted shall, without limit, be jointly and severally liable therefor, unless otherwise agreed. Article 8 Completion of the formalities of disclosure of the particulars concerning the persons who, as an organ of the company, are authorised to represent it shall constitute a bar to any irregularity in their appointment being relied upon as against third parties unless the company proves that such third parties had knowledge thereof. Article 9 1. Acts done by the organs of the company shall be binding upon it even if those acts are not within the objects of the company, unless such acts exceed the powers that the law confers or allows to be conferred on those organs. However, Member States may provide that the company shall not be bound where such acts are outside the objects of the company, if it proves that the third party knew that the act was outside those objects or could not in view of the circumstances have been unaware of it; disclosure of the statutes shall not of itself be sufficient proof thereof. 2. The limits on the powers of the organs of the company, arising under the statutes or from a decision of the competent organs, may never be relied on as against third parties, even if they have been disclosed. 3. If the national law provides that authority to represent a company may, in derogation from the legal rules governing the subject, be conferred by the statutes on a single person or on several persons acting jointly, that law may provide that such a provision in the statutes may be relied on as against third parties on condition that it relates to the general power of representation; the question whether such a provision in the statutes can be relied on as against third parties shall be governed by Article 3. SECTION III Nullity of the company Article 10 In all Member States whose laws do not provide for preventive control, administrative or judicial, at the time of formation of a company, the instrument of constitution, the company statutes and any amendments to those documents shall be drawn up and certified in due legal form. Article 11 The laws of the Member States may not provide for the nullity of companies otherwise than in accordance with the following provisions: 1. Nullity must be ordered by decision of a court of law; 2. Nullity may be ordered only on the following grounds: (a) that no instrument of constitution was executed or that the rules of preventive control or the requisite legal formalities were not complied with; (b) that the objects of the company are unlawful or contrary to public policy; (c) that the instrument of constitution or the statutes do not state the name of the company, the amount of the individual subscriptions of capital, the total amount of the capital subscribed or the objects of the company; (d) failure to comply with the provisions of the national law concerning the minimum amount of capital to be paid up; (e) the incapacity of all the founder members; (f) that, contrary to the national law governing the company, the number of founder members is less than two. Apart from the foregoing grounds of nullity, a company shall not be subject to any cause of non-existence, nullity absolute, nullity relative or declaration of nullity. Article 12 1. The question whether a decision of nullity pronounced by a court of law may be relied on as against third parties shall be governed by Article 3. Where the national law entitles a third party to challenge the decision, he may do so only within six months of public notice of the decision of the court being given. 2. Nullity shall entail the winding up of the company, as may dissolution. 3. Nullity shall not of itself affect the validity of any commitments entered into by or with the company, without prejudice to the consequences of the company's being wound up. 4. The laws of each Member State may make provision for the consequences of nullity as between members of the company. 5. Holders of shares in the capital shall remain obliged to pay up the capital agreed to be subscribed by them but which has not been paid up, to the extent that commitments entered into with creditors so require. SECTION IV General provisions Article 13 Member States shall put into force, within eighteen months following notification of this Directive, all amendments to their laws, regulations or administrative provisions required in order to comply with provisions of this Directive and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. The obligation of disclosure provided for in Article 2 (1) (f) shall not enter into force until thirty months after notification of this Directive in respect of naamloze vennootschappen under Netherlands law other than those referred to in the present Article 42 (c) of the Netherlands Commercial Code. Member States may provide that initial disclosure of the full text of the statutes as amended since the formation of the company shall not be required until the statutes are next amended or until 31 December 1970, whichever shall be the earlier. Member States shall ensure that they communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. Article 14 This Directive is addressed to the Member States. Done at Brussels, 9 March 1968. For the Council The President M. COUVE de MURVILLE"
"80","31967L0227","Article 1 Member States shall replace their present system of turnover taxes by the common system of value added tax defined in Article 2. In each Member State the legislation to effect this replacement shall be enacted as rapidly as possible, so that it can enter into force on a date to be fixed by the Member State in the light of the conjunctural situation ; this date shall not be later than 1 January 1970. From the entry into force of such legislation, the Member State shall not maintain or introduce any measure providing for flat-rate equalisation of turnover taxes on importation or exportation in trade between Member States. Article 2 The principle of the common system of value added tax involves the application to goods and services of a general tax on consumption exactly proportional to the price of the goods and services, whatever the number of transactions which take place in the production and distribution process before the stage at which tax is charged. On each transaction, value added tax, calculated on the price of the goods or services at the rate applicable to such goods or services, shall be chargeable after deduction of the amount of value added tax borne directly by the various cost components. The commom system of value added tax shall be applied up to and including the retail trade stage. However, until the abolition of the imposition of tax on importation and the remission of tax on exportation in trade between Member States, Member States may, subject to the consultation provided for in Article 5, apply this system only up to and including the wholesale trade stage, and may apply, as appropriate, a separate complementary tax at the retail trade stage or at the preceding stage. Article 3 The Council shall issue, on a proposal from the Commission, a second Directive concerning the structure of, and the procedure for applying, the common system of value added tax. Article 4 In order to enable the Council to discuss this, and if possible to take decisions before the end of the transitional period, the Commission shall submit to the Council, before the end of 1968, proposals as to how and within what period the harmonisation of turnover taxes can achieve the aim of abolishing the imposition of tax on importation and the remission of tax on exportation in trade between Member States, while ensuring the neutrality of those taxes as regards the origin of the goods or services. In this connection, particular account shall be taken of the relationship between direct and indirect taxes, which differs in the various Member States ; of the effects of an alteration in tax systems on the tax and budget policy of Member States ; and of the influence which tax systems have on conditions of competition and on social conditions in the Community. Article 5 Should a Member State intend to exercise the power provided for in the last paragraph of Article 2, it shall so inform the Commission in good time, having regard to Article 102 of the Treaty. Article 6 This Directive is addressed to the Member States. Done at Brussels, 11 April 1967. For the Council The President R. VAN ELSLANDE"

The following shall also be approved for intra-Community trade : animals for breeding or production or animals for slaughter acquired on an officially approved market for consignment to another Member State, provided such market fulfils the following conditions: (a) it is supervised by an official veterinarian; (b) it is situated in the centre of an epizootic free area and in a place where no other livestock market is held on the same day; (c) it is used after disinfection either for animals for breeding or production or for animals for slaughter which meet the requirements of intra-Community trade as laid down in paragraphs 2 to 6 and in Article 4, provided these conditions apply to the animal species in question. The provisions of paragraph 2 (e) must in particular have been complied with when the animals were sent to market. Before being taken from the holding or market meeting the requirements of this paragraph to the place of loading, these animals may be taken to an officially supervised assembly point if the latter satisfies the conditions fixed for markets. Animals acquired on such markets must be sent direct from the market or the assembly point to the actual place of loading in such manner that the provisions of paragraph 2 (e) and (g) are satisfied, and be exported to the country of destination. The period during which the assembling of these animals takes place outside the holding of origin, in particular at the market, assembly point or actual place of loading may be counted in the thirty days prescribed in paragraph 2 (c) but shall not exceed four days. 8. The exporting country shall designate those markets referred to in paragraph 7 which are approved for animals for breeding or production and for animals for slaughter. It shall notify the competent central authorities of the other Member States and the Commission as to which markets are approved. 9. The exporting country shall determine the procedure for official supervision of the markets and assembly points referred to in paragraph 7 and shall ensure that this supervision is carried out. 10. In the case provided for in paragraph 7, corresponding entries must be made on the health certificates, in accordance with Annex F (Models I to IV). 11. The exporting country shall determine the procedure for official supervision of dealers' premises and shall ensure that this supervision is carried out. 12. If a holding or the area in which it is situated is the subject of official restrictions following the outbreak of a disease which is contagious or infectious for the animal species in question, the time limits set in paragraph 2 (b) (ii) and (iii) and Article 2 (e) shall take effect from the date on which these prohibition restrictions were officially lifted. Article 4 1. All animals intended for intra-Community trade must have remained in the territory of the exporting Member State before the day of loading: (a) for not less than six months in the case of animals for breeding or production; (b) for not less than three months in the case of animals for slaughter. If such animals are respectively less than six or three months old they must have remained in the territory of the exporting Member State since birth. 2. In all cases to which paragraph 1 applies, appropriate entries must be made in the health certificates, as required by Annex F (Models I to IV). Article 5 If the vaccines referred to in Article 3 (3) (a) and (6) (a) are not manufactured in a Member State, they shall be obtained from another Member State, except where new scientific data or the absence of vaccines which up to that time have been considered suitable makes it necessary to obtain vaccines from outside the European Economic Community. In the event of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease other than types A, O and C or variants of these types, against which the vaccines currently used afford inadequate protection or none at all, each Member State may take the necessary emergency measures to adapt the vaccine formulae and to use them accordingly. At the same time it shall inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof. The Commission may arrange for discussions to take place concerning the measures taken and to be taken. Article 6 1. Each Member State shall communicate to the other Member States and the Commission the list of frontier posts to be used for the introduction of bovine animals and swine into its territory. Subject to observance of the provisions relating to animal health, marketing channels and all means of transport available for use shall be taken into account in determining which frontier posts are to be used. 2. Each country of destination may require the consignor or his representative to notify it in advance of the entry into its territory of a consignment of bovine animals or swine, and of the type, nature and number of animals, the frontier post and the anticipated time of arrival. It may not, however, require this notification to be made more than forty-eight hours before the arrival of the consignment in its territory. 3. Each country of destination may prohibit the introduction of bovine animals and swine into its territory if an examination made at the frontier post by an official veterinarian reveals: (a) that the animals are affected by, or suspected of being affected by, or of being contaminated by a compulsorily notifiable disease; (b) that the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 have not been observed as regards these animals. The country of destination may take the necessary measures, including quarantine, to ascertain the position as regards animals suspected of being affected by or of being contaminated by a compulsorily notifiable disease or which might spread such disease. Decisions taken under the first or second sentence must, at the request of the consignor or his representative, authorise the return of the animals, provided this is not contrary to considerations of health. 4. If the introduction of animals has been prohibited on any of the grounds set out in paragraph 3 (a) and the exporting country or the transit country, as the case may be, does not within eight hours authorise the return of them, the competent authority of the country of destination may order the animals to be slaughtered or destroyed. 5. Animals for slaughter must be slaughtered as soon as possible after their arrival at the slaughterhouse, in accordance with animal health requirements. Animals for slaughter which have been sent direct on arrival in the country of destination to a market adjoining a slaughterhouse under whose rules all animals may be removed, in particular after the market, only to a slaughterhouse approved for this purpose by the competent central authority must be slaughtered at that slaughterhouse not later than seventy-two hours after arriving at the market. The competent authority of the country of destination may in the light of considerations of animal health designate the slaughterhouse to which these animals must be sent. 6. If, after the introduction into the territory of the country of destination of animals for breeding or production, facts come to light which would have justified the application of the first sentence of paragraph 3, the competent central authority of the exporting country must, at the request of the competent central authority of the country of destination, make the necessary investigations and notify that authority without delay of the outcome of such investigations. 7. The decisions taken by the competent authority under paragraphs 3 to 5 must be communicated to the consignor or his representative, together with the reasons for such decisions. These reasoned decisions must on request, be communicated to him forthwith in writing with an indication of what appeals against them are open under current legislation and the form and time in which they must be commenced. The decisions must also be communicated to the competent central authority of the exporting country. Article 7 1. Countries of destination may grant to one or more exporting countries general authorisations or authorisations restricted to specific cases for the introduction into their territory or: A. Bovine animals for breeding, production or slaughter: (a) which, by way of derogation from Article 3 (3) (a) or 6 (a), have not been vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease, if no case of foot-and-mouth disease has been officially recorded in the exporting country and in the transit countries concerned for at least six months preceding the date of loading; (b) which, by way of derogation from Article 3 (3) (a) or (6) (a) have received anti-foot-and-mouth disease serum treatment, not more than ten days before loading, with an anti-foot-and-mouth disease serum approved and controlled by the competent authority of the exporting country and authorised by the competent authority of the country of destination. B. Bovine animals for breeding or production which, by way of derogation from Article 3 (3) (c), come from a brucellosis-free herd. C. Bovine animals for slaughter: (a) which, by way of derogation from Article 3 (6) (b), have reacted positively to an intradermal tuberculin test; (b) which, by way of derogation from Article 3 (6) (c), have shown a brucella count equal to or higher than 30 international units of agglutination per millilitre when given a sero-agglutination test. 2. When a country of destination grants a general authorisation under paragraph 1, it shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof. 3. When a country of destination grants any authorisation under paragraph 1, a corresponding authorisation must, in the case of transit operations, be obtained from the transit countries concerned. 4. The exporting countries shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the health certificates, specimens of which are given in Annex F (Models I and II), mention that use has been made of one of the possibilities provided in paragraph 1. Article 8 Until the entry into force of such provisions as may be adopted by the European Economic Community, this Directive shall not affect the provisions of Member States relating to: (a) bovine animals and swine which have been treated with antibiotics, oestrogens or thyreostatics; (b) the prevention of trichinosis, on condition that those provisions are not applied in a discriminatory manner, having regard particularly to the implementation of systematic research to reveal trichina in exporting Member States. Article 9 1. A Member State may take the following measures if there is a danger of animal diseases spreading as a result of the introduction into its territory of bovine animals or swine from another Member State: (a) in the event of an outbreak of an epizootic disease in the other Member State, temporarily prohibit or restrict the introduction of bovine animals or swine from the affected areas of that Member State; (b) if an epizootic disease becomes widespread or if there is an outbreak of another serious contagious or infectious animal disease, temporarily prohibit or restrict the introduction of bovine animals and swine from any part of the territory of that State. 2. Measures taken by a Member State under paragraph 1 must be communicated within ten working days to the other Member States and the Commission together with the precise reasons for such measures. 3. If the Member State concerned considers that the prohibition or restriction referred to in paragraph 1 is unjustified, it may apply to the Commission for the immediate opening of discussions. Article 10 1. Rights of appeal existing under current legislation in the Member States against decisions taken pursuant to this Directive by the competent authorities shall not be affected by this Directive. 2. Each Member State shall grant to consignors in respect of whose bovine animal and swine such measures as are provided for in Article 6 (3) have been taken, the right to obtain, before other measures are taken by the competent authority other than the slaughter or destruction of animals if essential for considerations of animal or public health, the opinion of a veterinary expert to determine whether the conditions of Article 6 (3) have been fulfilled. The veterinary expert must be a national of a Member State other than the exporting country or country of destination. The Commission, acting on a proposal from the Member States, shall drawn up a panel of veterinary experts who may be instructed to formulate such opinions. After consulting the Member States it shall lay down general rules which are to be applied, in particular as regards the procedure for formulation of these opinions. Article 11 If the Community provisions relating to importation of bovine animals and swine from third countries do not apply at the time when this Directive enters into force, or pending their becoming applicable, national provisions relating to bovine animals and swine imported from those countries shall not be more favourable than those governing intra-Community trade. Article 12 The Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive and its Annexes within twelve months following its notification and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.

Member States, acting in accordance with the provisions hereinafter laid down, shall adopt the following transitional measures in respect of establishment or provision of services in their territories by natural persons or companies or firms covered by Title I of the General Programmes (hereinafter called ""beneficiaries"") wishing to engage in activities as self-employed persons in manufacturing and processing industries. 2. The activities in question are those covered by the Council Directive of 7 July 1964 concerning the attainment of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of activities of self-employed persons in manufacturing and processing industries falling within ISIC Major Groups 23-40 (Industry and small craft industries). Article 2 Member States in which the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 1 (2) is subject to possession of certain qualifications shall ensure that any beneficiary who applies therefor be provided, before he establishes himself or before he begins to pursue any activity on a temporary basis, with information as to the rules governing the occupation which he proposes to pursue. Article 3 Where, in a Member State, the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 1 (2) is dependent on the possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge and ability, that Member State shall accept as sufficient evidence of such knowledge and ability the fact that the activity in question has been pursued in another Member State for any of the following periods: (a) six consecutive years either in an indepedent capacity or as a person responsible for managing an undertaking ; or (b) three consecutive years either in an independent capacity or as a person responsible for managing an undertaking, where the beneficiary can prove that for the occupation in question he has received at least three years' previous training, attested by a certificate recognised by the State, or regarded by the competent professional body as fully satisfying its requirements ; or (c) three consecutive years in an indepedent capacity, where the beneficiary can prove that he has pursued the occupation in question for at least five years in a non-independent capacity ; or (d) five consecutive years in a managerial capacity, not less than three years of which were in technical posts with responsibility for one or more departments of the undertaking, where the beneficiary can prove that for the occupation in question he has received at least three years' previous training, attested by a certificate recognised by the State or regarded by the competent professional body as fully satisfying its requirements. In the cases referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (c) pursuit of the activity shall not have ceased more than ten years before the date when the application provided for in Article 4 (3) is made. Article 4 For the purpose of applying Article 3: 1. Member States in which the taking up and pursuit of any occupation referred to in Article 1 (2) is subject to the possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge or ability shall, with the assistance of the Commission, inform the other Member States of the main characteristics of that occupation (description of the activities covered by the occupation). 2. The competent authority designated for this purpose by the country whence the beneficiary comes shall certify what professional activities were actually pursued by the beneficiary and the duration of those activities. Certificates shall be drawn up having regard to the official description of the occupation in question supplied by the Member State in which the beneficiary wishes to pursue such occupation, whether permanently or temporarily. 3. The host Member State shall grant authorisation to pursue the activity in question on application by the person concerned, provided that the activity certified conforms to the main features of the description of the activity communicated pursuant to paragraph 1 and provided that any other requirements laid down by the rules of that State are satisfied. Article 5 1. Where, in a Member State, the taking up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Article 1 (2) is not subject to the possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge or ability, that State may, if serious difficulties result from the application of the Council Directive referred to in Article 1 (2), request from the Commission authorisation, for a limited period and in respect of one or more specified activities, to require from nationals of other Member States who wish to pursue those activities in its territory proof that they possess the qualifications required for the pursuit of such activities in the country whence they come. Use shall not be made of this power in respect of a person who comes from a country which does not make the taking up of the activity in question subject to proof of particular knowledge, or in respect of a person who has lived in the host country for at least five years. 2. On receipt of a request from the Member State concerned stating the reasons on which it is based, the Commission shall forthwith specify the conditions on which the authorisation provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article will be granted and lay down detailed rules concerning its implementation. 3. Where serious difficulties result from the application of the Council Directive referred to in Article 1 (2), the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may be authorised by the Commission, for such period and subject to such conditions as the Commission shall determine, to suspend application of the provisions of Article 3 of this Directive in respect of one or more specified activities.

The sluice-gate price for eggs for hatching shall be calculated in the same way as the sluice-gate price for eggs in shell ; however, the price for the quantity of feed grain on the world market shall be the price for the quantity required for the production in third countries of one egg for hatching and the standard amount shall be the amount representing other feeding costs and overhead costs of production and marketing in respect of one egg for hatching. 4. As regards the products specified in Article 1 (1) (b), the sluice-gate prices shall be derived from the sluice-gate price for eggs in shell, account being taken of the depreciation in value of the basic material, of the coefficients fixed for such products under Article 5 (2) and of a standard amount representing overhead costs of production and marketing fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17. 5. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt rules for the application of this Article. Article 8 1. Where the free-at-frontier offer price for a product falls below the sluice-gate price, the levy on that product shall be increased by an additional amount equal to the difference between the sluice-gate price and the free-at-frontier offer price. 2. However, the levy shall not be increased by this additional amount as regards third countries which are prepared and in a position to guarantee that the price of imports into the Community of products originating in and coming from their territory will not be lower than the sluice-gate price for the product in question and that any deflection of trade will be avoided. 3. The free-at-frontier offer price shall be determined for all imports from all third countries. However, if exports from one or more third countries are effected at abnormally low prices, lower than the prices ruling in other third countries, a second free-at-frontier offer price shall be determined for exports from these other countries. 4. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17. Where additional amounts are required these shall be fixed in accordance with the same procedure. Article 9 1. To the extent necessary to enable the products specified in Article 1 (1) to be exported, in the state referred to therein or in the form of products listed in Annex I hereto, on the basis of prices for those products on the world market, the difference between those prices and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. 2. The refund shall be the same for the whole Community. It may be varied according to use or destination. The refund shall be granted on application by the party concerned. When the refund is being fixed particular account shall be taken of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward processing arrangements. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt general rules for the granting and advance fixing of export refunds and criteria for fixing their amount. Refunds shall be fixed at regular intervals in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17.

Before 1 August of each year a basic price shall be fixed, valid from 1 November of the same year, for meat of domestic swine in carcases or half-carcases (hereinafter called ""pig carcases"") of a standard quality defined with reference to a Community scale for grading pig carcases. When the basic price is being fixed account shall be taken of: - the sluice-gate price and the levy applicable during the quarter beginning 1 August of each year; - the need to fix this price at a level which contributes towards stabilizing market prices without, however, leading to the formation of structural surpluses within the Community. 2. Intervention measures may be taken when the Community market price for pig carcases, as established by reference to the prices recorded in each Member State on the representative markets of the Community and weighted by means of coefficients reflecting the relative size of the pig herd in each Member State, is, and is likely to remain, at less than 103 % of the basic price. 3. The intervention agencies designated by the Member States shall take intervention measures under the conditions laid down in Articles 5 to 7. 4. The procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty shall apply for the purposes of: - fixing the basic price, - determining a standard quality for pig carcases. 5.

For products of standard quality other than pig carcases, buying-in prices shall be derived from the buying-in price for pig carcases on the basis of the ratio of each of the sluice-gate prices for these products to the sluice-gate prices for pig carcases. 3. For products other than those of standard quality, buying-in prices shall be derived from those in force for the relevant standard qualities, by reference to differences in quality in relation to the standard quality. These prices shall apply to defined qualities. 4. The procedure laid down in Article 24 shall apply for the purposes of: (a) determining the products to which intervention measures are to apply and specifying the qualities which may be bought in ; moreover, as regards certain regions of the Community, some weight categories may be excluded from intervention where they are not representative of pigmeat production in that region; (b) fixing the buying-in prices and the amount of private storage aid; (c) adopting detailed rules for the application of this Article, in particular the conditions governing the buying-in and storage of products in respect of which the intervention measures provided for in Article 3 are applied.

Article 9 1. The levy on pig carcases shall be composed of: (a) one component equal to the difference between prices within the Community and on the world market for the quantity of feed grain required for the production in the Community of one kilogramme of pigmeat. The prices for feed grain within the Community shall be determined once a year for a period of 12 months beginning 1 August, on the basis of the threshold prices for such grain and the monthly increase thereof. The prices for feed grain on the world market shall be determined quarterly on the basis of the prices for such grain for the six months preceding the quarter during which the said component is calculated. However, when the levies applicable from 1 November, 1 February and 1 May are being fixed, trends in world market prices for feed grain shall be taken into account only if at the same time a new sluice-gate price is being fixed. (b) one component equal to 7 % of the average of the sluice-gate prices ruling for the four quarters preceding 1 May of each year. This component shall be calculated once a year for a period of 12 months beginning 1 August. 2.

The coefficients expressing the ratios mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24. Article 11 When a substantial price rise is recorded on the Community market and this situation is likely to continue, thereby disturbing or threatening to disturb the market, the necessary measures may be taken.

Sluice-gate prices shall be fixed in advance for each quarter in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24. 2. The sluice-gate price for pig carcases shall be composed of: (a) an amount equal to the value on the world market of the quantity of feed grain equivalent to the quantity of feedingstuffs required for the production in third countries of one kilogramme of pigmeat; (b) a standard amount representing the extra cost, in relation to feed grain of feedingstuffs other than grain required for the production of one kilogramme of pigmeat; c) a standard amount representing overhead costs of production and marketing. The value of the quantity of feed grain shall be determined quarterly on the basis of the world market prices for cereals recorded in the course of the six months preceding the quarter during which the sluice-gate price is fixed. However, when the sluice-gate price applicable from 1 November, 1 February and 1 May is being fixed, trends in world market prices for feed grain shall be taken into account only if the value of the quantity of feed grain varies by at least a specified minimum in relation to that used in calculating the sluice-gate price for the preceding quarter. 3. Sluice-gate prices shall be fixed only for certain of the products other than pig carcases specified in Article 1 (1). Such sluice-gate prices shall be derived from the sluice-gate price for pig carcases on the basis of the ratio fixed for such products under Article 10 (4). 4. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall - determine the quantity of feed grain specified in paragraph 2 (a) and the percentages of the various feed grains included in that quantity, - adopt a list of the products for which sluice-gate prices are to be fixed, - adopt rules for calculating the sluice-gate price for pig carcases. Article 13 1. Where the free-at-frontier offer price for a product falls below the sluice-gate price, the levy on that product shall be increased by an additional amount equal to the difference between the sluice-gate price and the free-at-frontier offer price. For certain of the products for which no sluice-gate price is fixed, a system of ""pilot products"" and ""derived products"" shall be established to enable additional amounts to be fixed. 2. However, the levy shall not be increased by the aforesaid additional amount as regards third countries which are prepared and in a position to guarantee that the price for imports into the Community of products originating in and coming from their territory will not be lower than the sluice-gate price for the product in question and that any deflection of trade will be avoided. 3. The free-at-frontier offer price shall be determined for all imports from all third countries. However, if exports from one or more third countries are effected at abnormally low prices, lower than the prices ruling in other countries, a second free-at-frontier offer price shall be determined for exports from these other countries. 4. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt general rules concerning the system provided for in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1. 5. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24.

The importation into the Community of any of the products listed in Article 1 (1) may be made conditional on the submission of an import licence which shall be issued by Member States to any applicant irrespective of the place of his establishment in the Community. Such licence shall be valid for an importation carried out anywhere in the Community. The issue of such licences shall be conditional on the provision of security as a guarantee that importation will be effected during the period of validity of the licence ; the security shall be wholly or partially forfeit if importation is not effected, or is only partially effected, within that period. 2. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt a list of the products for which import licences are required. 3.

The refund shall be the same for the whole Community. It may be varied according to use or destination. The refund shall be granted on application by the party concerned. 3. When the refund is being fixed particular account shall be taken of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward processing arrangements. 4.

TITLE III Conditions governing the exchange of information Article 7 1. A requested authority in one Member State shall provide an applicant authority in another Member State with the information referred to in Article 5 (2) provided that: - the number and the nature of the requests for information made by the applicant authority within a specific period of time do not impose a disproportionate administrative burden on that requested authority, - that applicant authority exhausts the usual sources of information which it can use in the circumstances to obtain the information requested, without running the risk of jeopardizing the achievement of the desired end, - that applicant authority requests assistance only if it would be able to provide similar assistance to the applicant authority of another Member State. In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10 and taking into account experience of the new administrative cooperation system during its first year of operation, the Commission shall submit general criteria for the definition of the scope of these commitments before July 1994. 2. If an applicant authority is unable to comply with the general provisions of paragraph 1 it shall notify the requested authority accordingly without delay, stating its reasons. If a requested authority considers that the general provisions of paragraph 1 are not complied with and that it is therefore not obliged to provide the information, it shall notify the applicant authority accordingly without delay, stating its reasons. The applicant authority and the requested authority shall attempt to reach agreement. If they fail to reach agreement within one month of notification either authority may request that the matter be examined under Article 11. 3. This Article shall be without prejudice to the application of Directive 77/799/EEC as regards the exchange of information referred to in Article 5 (1). Article 8 In cases of exchanges of information as defined in Article 5, where the national legislation in force in a Member State provides for notification of the person concerned of the exchange of information, those provisions may continue to apply except where their application would prejudice the investigation of tax evasion in another Member State. In the latter event, at the express request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall refrain from such notification. Article 9 1. Any information communicated in whatever form pursuant to this Regulation shall be of a confidential nature. It shall be covered by the obligation of professional secrecy and shall enjoy the protection extended to similar information under both the national law of the Member State which received it and the corresponding provisions applicable to Community authorities. In any case, such information: - may be made available only to the persons directly concerned with the bases of assessment, collection or administrative control of taxes for the purspose of the assessment of taxes, or to persons employed by Community institutions whose duties require that they have access to it, - may in addition be used in connection with judicial or administrative proceedings that may involve sanctions, initiated as a result of infringements of tax law. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the competent authority of the Member State providing the information shall permit its use for other purposes in the Member State of the applicant authority, if, under the legislation of the Member State of the requested authority, the information could be used in the Member State of the requested authority for similar purposes. 3. Where the applicant authority considers that information which it has received from the requested authority is likely to be useful to the competent authority of a third Member State, it may transmit it to the latter with the agreement of the requested authority.

"97","31989R4064","Article 1 Scope 1. Without prejudice to Article 22 this Regulation shall apply to all concentrations with a Community dimension as defined in paragraph 2. 2. For the purposes of this Regulation, a concentration has a Community dimension where; (a) the aggregate worldwide turnover of all the undertakings concerned is more than ECU 5 000 million, and (b) the aggregate Community-wide turnover of each of at least two of the undertakings concerned is more than ECU 250 million, unless each of the undertakings concerned achieves more than two-thirds of its aggregate Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State. 3. The thresholds laid down in paragraph 2 will be reviewed before the end of the fourth year following that of the adoption of this Regulation by the Council acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission. Article 2 Appraisal of concentrations 1. Concentrations within the scope of this Regulation shall be appraised in accordance with the following provisions with a view to establishing whether or not they are compatible with the common market. In making this appraisal, the Commission shall take into account: (a) the need to preserve and develop effective competition within the common market in view of, among other things, the structure of all the markets concerned and the actual or potential competition from undertakings located either within or without the Community; (b) the market position of the undertakings concerned and their economic and financial power, the opportunities available to suppliers and users, their access to supplies or markets, any legal or other barriers to entry, supply and demand trends for the relevant goods and services, the interests of the intermediate and ultimate consumers, and the development of technical and economic progress provided that it is to consumers' advantage and does not form an obstacle to competition. 2. A concentration which does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the common market or in a substantial part of it shall be declared compatible with the common market. 3. A concentration which creates or strengthens a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the common market or in a substantial part of it shall be declared incompatible with the common market. Article 3 Definition of concentration 1. A concentration shall be deemed to arise where: (a) two or more previously independent undertakings merge, or (b) one or more persons already controlling at least one undertaking, or - one or more undertakings acquire, whether by purchase of securities or assets, by contract or by any other means, direct or indirect control of the whole or parts of one or more other undertakings. 2. An operation, including the creation of a joint venture, which has as its object or effect the coordination of the competitive behaviour of undertakings which remain independent shall not constitute a concentration within the meaning of paragraph 1 (b). The creation of a joint venture performing on a lasting basis all the functions of an autonomous economic entity, which does not give rise to coordination of the competitive behaviour of the parties amongst themselves or between them and the joint venture, shall constitute a concentration within the meaning of paragraph 1 (b). 3. For the purposes of this Regulation, control shall be constituted by rights, contracts or any other means which, either separately or jointly and having regard to the considerations of fact or law involved, confer the possibility of exercising decisive influence on an undertaking, in particular by: (a) ownership or the right to use all or part of the assets of an undertaking; (b) rights or contracts which confer decisive influence on the composition, voting or decisions of the organs of an undertaking. 4. Control is acquired by persons or undertakings which: (a) are holders of the rights or entitled to rights under the contracts concerned, or (b) while not being holders of such rights or entitled to rights under such contracts, have the power to exercise the rights deriving therefrom. 5. A concentration shall not be deemed to arise where: (a) credit institutions or other financial institutions or insurance companies, the normal activities of which include transactions and dealing in securities for their own account or for the account of others, hold on a temporary basis securities which they have acquired in an undertaking with a view to reselling them, provided that they do not exercise voting rights in respect of those securities with a view to determining the competitive behaviour of that undertaking or provided that they exercise such voting rights only with a view to preparing the sale of all or part of that undertaking or of its assets or the sale of those securities and that any such sale takes place within one year of the date of acquisition; that period may be extended by the Commission on request where such institutions or companies justify the fact that the sale was not reasonably possible within the period set; (b) control is acquired by an office holder according to the law of a Member State relating to liquidation, winding up, insolvency, cessation of payments, compositions or analogous proceedings; (c) the operations referred to in paragraph 1 (b) are carried out by the financial holding companies referred to in Article 5 (3) of the Fourth Council Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 on the annual accounts of certain types of companies (4), as last amended by Directive 84/569/EEC (5), provided however that the voting rights in respect of the holding are exercised, in particular in relation to the appointment of members of the management and supervisory bodies of the undertakings in which they have holdings, only to maintain the full value of those investments and not to determine directly or indirectly the competitive conduct of those undertakings. Article 4 Prior notification of concentrations 1. Concentrations with a Community dimension as referred to by this Regulation shall be notified to the Commission not more than one week after the conclusion of the agreement, or the announcement of the public bid, or the acquisition of a controlling interest. That week shall begin when the first of those events occurs. 2. A concentration which consists of a merger within the meaning of Article 3 (1) (a) or in the acquisition of joint control within the meaning of Article 3 (1) (b) shall be notified jointly by the parties to the merger or by those acquiring joint control as the case may be. In all other cases, the notification shall be effected by the person or undertaking acquiring control of the whole or parts of one or more undertakings. 3. Where the Commission finds that a notified concentration falls within the scope of this Regulation, it shall publish the fact of the notification, at the same time indicating the names of the parties, the nature of the concentration and the economic sectors involved. The Commission shall take account of the legitimate interest of undertakings in the protection of their business secrets. Article 5 Calculation of turnover 1. Aggregate turnover within the meaning of Article 1 (2) shall comprise the amounts derived by the undertakings concerned in the preceding financial year from the sale of products and the provision of services falling within the undertakings' ordinary activities after deduction of sales rebates and of value added tax and other taxes directly related to turnover. The aggregate turnover of an undertaking concerned shall not include the sale of products or the provision of services between any of the undertakings referred to in paragraph 4. Turnover, in the Community or in a Member State, shall comprise products sold and services provided to undertakings or consumers, in the Community or in that Member State as the case may be. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where the concentration consists in the acquisition of parts, whether or not constituted as legal entities, of one or more undertakings, only the turnover relating to the parts which are the subject of the transaction shall be taken into account with regard to the seller or sellers. However, two or more transactions within the meaning of the first subparagraph which take place within a two-year period between the same persons or undertakings shall be treated as one and the same concentration arising on the date of the last transaction. 3. In place of turnover the following shall be used: (a) for credit institutions and other financial institutions, as regards Article 1 (2) (a), one-tenth of their total assets. As regards Article 1 (2) (b) and the final part of Article 1 (2), total Community-wide turnover shall be replaced by one-tenth of total assets multiplied by the ratio between loans and advances to credit institutions and customers in transactions with Community residents and the total sum of those loans and advances. As regards the final part of Article 1 (2), total turnover within one Member State shall be replaced by one-tenth of total assets multiplied by the ratio between loans and advances to credit institutions and customers in transactions with residents of that Member State and the total sum of those loans and advances; (b) for insurance undertakings, the value of gross premiums written which shall comprise all amounts received and receivable in respect of insurance contracts issued by or on behalf of the insurance undertakings, including also outgoing reinsurance premiums, and after deduction of taxes and parafiscal contributions or levies charged by reference to the amounts of individual premiums or the total volume of premiums; as regards Article 1 (2) (b) and the final part of Article 1 (2), gross premiums received from Community residents and from residents of one Member State respectively shall be taken into account. 4. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the turnover of an undertaking concerned within the meaning of Article 1 (2) shall be calculated by adding together the respective turnover of the following: (a) the undertaking concerned; (b) those undertakings in which the undertaking concerned, directly or indirectly; - owns more than half the capital or business assets, or - has the power to exercise more than half the voting rights, or - has the power to appoint more than half the members of the supervisory board, the administrative board or bodies legally representing the undertakings, or - has the right to manage the undertakings' affairs; (c) those undertakings which have in an undertaking concerned the rights or powers listed in (b); (d) those undertakings in which an undertaking as referred to in (c) has the rights or powers listed in (b); (e) those undertakings in which two or more undertakings as referred to in (a) to (d) jointly have the rights or powers listed in (b). 5. Where undertakings concerned by the concentration jointly have the rights or powers listed in paragraph 4 (b), in calculating the turnover of the undertakings concerned for the purposes of Article 1 (2); (a) no account shall be taken of the turnover resulting from the sale of products or the provision of services between the joint undertaking and each of the undertakings concerned or any other undertaking connected with any one of them, as set out in paragraph 4 (b) to (e); (b) account shall be taken of the turnover resulting from the sale of products and the provision of services between the joint undertaking and any third undertakings. This turnover shall be apportioned equally amongst the undertakings concerned. Article 6 Examination of the notification and initiation of proceedings 1. The Commission shall examine the notification as soon as it is received. (a) Where it concludes that the concentration notified does not fall within the scope of this Regulation, it shall record that finding by means of a decision. (b) Where it finds that the concentration notified, although falling within the scope of this Regulation, does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market, it shall decide not to oppose it and shall declare that it is compatible with the common market. (c) If, on the other hand, it finds that the concentration notified falls within the scope of this Regulation and raises serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market, it shall decide to initiate proceedings. 2. The Commission shall notify its decision to the undertakings concerned and the competent authorities of the Member States without delay. Article 7 Suspension of concentrations 1. For the purposes of paragraph 2 a concentration as defined in Article 1 shall not be put into effect either before its notification or within the first three weeks following its notification. 2. Where the Commission, following a preliminary examination of the notification within the period provided for in paragraph 1, finds it necessary in order to ensure the full effectiveness of any decision taken later pursuant to Article 8 (3) and (4), it may decide on its own initiative to continue the suspension of a concentration in whole or in part until it takes a final decision, or to take other interim measures to that effect. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not impede the implementation of a public bid which has been notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 4 (1) by the date of its announcement, provided that the acquirer does not exercise the voting rights attached to the securities in question or does so only to maintain the full value of those investments and on the basis of a derogation granted by the Commission pursuant to paragraph 4. 4. The Commission may, on request, grant a derogation from the obligations imposed in paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 in order to prevent serious damage to one or more undertakings concerned by a concentration or to a third party. That derogation may be made subject to conditions and obligations in order to ensure conditions of effective competition. A derogation may be applied for and granted at any time, even before notification or after the transaction. 5. The validity of any transaction carried out in contravention of paragraph 1 or 2 shall be dependent on a decision pursuant to Article 6 (1) (b) or 8 (2) or (3) or by virtue of the presumption established by Article 10 (6). This Article shall, however, have no effect on the validity of transactions in securities including those convertible into other securities admitted to trading on a market which is regulated and supervised by authorities recognized by public bodies, operates regularly and is accessible directly or indirectly to the public, unless the buyer and seller knew or ought to have known that the transaction was carried out in contravention of paragraph 1 or 2. Article 8 Powers of decision of the Commission 1. Without prejudice to Article 9, each proceeding initiated pursuant to Article 6 (1) (c) shall be closed by means of a decision as provided for in paragraphs 2 to 5. 2. Where the Commission finds that, following modification by the undertakings concerned if necessary, a notified concentration fulfils the criterion laid down in Article 2 (2), it shall issue a decision declaring the concentration compatible with the common market. It may attach to its decision conditions and obligations intended to ensure that the undertakings concerned comply with the commitments they have entered into vis-Ã -vis the Commission with a view to modifying the original concentration plan. The decision declaring the concentration compatible shall also cover restrictions directly related and necessary to the implementation of the concentration. 3. Where the Commission finds that a concentration fulfils the criterion laid down in Article 2 (3), it shall issue a decision declaring that the concentration is incompatible with the common market. 4. Where a concentration has already been implemented, the Commission may, in a decision pursuant to paragraph 3 or by a separate decision, require the undertakings or assets brought together to be separated or the cessation of joint control or any other action that may be appropriate in order to restore conditions of effective competition. 5. The Commission may revoke the decision it has taken pursuant to paragraph 2 where: (a) the declaration of compatibility is based on incorrect information for which one of the undertakings concerned is responsible or where it has been obtained by deceit, or (b) the undertakings concerned commit a breach of an obligation attached to the decision. 6. In the case referred to in paragraph 5, the Commission may take a decision pursuant to paragraph 3, without being bound by the deadline referred to in Article 10 (3). Article 9 Referral to the competent authorities of the Member States 1. The Commission may, by means of a decision notified without delay to the undertakings concerned and the competent authorities of the other Member States, refer a notified concentration to the competent authorities of the Member State concerned in the following circumstances. 2. Within three weeks of the date of receipt of the copy of the notification a Member State may inform the Commission which shall inform the undertakings concerned that a concentration threatens to create or to strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded on a market, within that Member State, which presents all the characteristics of a distinct market, be it a substantial part of the common market or not. 3. If the Commission considers that, having regard to the market for the products or services in question and the geographical reference market within the meaning of paragraph 7, there is such a distinct market and that such a threat exists either: (a) it shall itself deal with the case in order to maintain or restore effective competition on the market concerned, or (b) it shall refer the case to the competent authorities of the Member State concerned with a view to the application of that State's national competition law. If, however, the Commission considers that such a distinct market or threat does not exist it shall adopt a decision to that effect which it shall address to the Member State concerned. 4. A decision to refer or not to refer pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be taken where: (a) as a general rule within the six-week period provided for in Article 10 (1), second subparagraph, where the Commission has not initiated proceedings pursuant to Article 6 (1) (b), or (b) within three months at most of the notification of the concentration concerned where the Commission has initiated proceedings under Article 6 (1) (c), without taking the preparatory steps in order to adopt the necessary measures pursuant to Article 8 (2), second subparagraph, (3) or (4) to maintain or restore effective competition on the market concerned. 5. If within the three months referred to in paragraph 4 (b) the Commission, despite a reminder from the Member State concerned, has taken no decision on referral in accordance with paragraph 3 or taken the preparatory steps referred to in paragraph 4 (b), it shall be deemed to have taken a decision to refer the case to the Member State concerned in accordance with paragraph 3 (b). 6. The publication of any report or the announcement of the findings of the examination of the concentration by the competent authority of the Member State concerned shall be effected not more than four months after the Commission's referral. 7. The geographical reference market shall consist of the area in which the undertakings concerned are involved in the supply of products or services, in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous and which can be distinguished from neighbouring areas because, in particular, conditions of competition are appreciably different in those areas. This assessment should take account in particular of the nature and characteristics of the products or services concerned, of the existence of entry barriers or of consumer preferences, of appreciable differences of the undertakings' market shares between neighbouring areas or of substantial price differences. 8. In applying the provisions of this Article, the Member State concerned may take only the measures strictly necessary to safeguard or restore effective competition on the market concerned. 9. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty, any Member State may appeal to the Court of Justice, and in particular request the application of Article 186, for the purpose of applying its national competition law. 10. This Article will be reviewed before the end of the fourth year following that of the adoption of this Regulation. Article 10 Time limits for initiating proceedings and for decisions 1. The decisions referred to in Article 6 (1) must be taken within one month at most. That period shall begin on the day following the receipt of a notification or, if the information to be supplied with the notification is incomplete, on the day following the receipt of the complete information. That period shall be increased to six weeks if the Commission receives a request from a Member State in accordance with Article 9 (2). 2. Decisions taken pursuant to Article 8 (2) concerning notified concentrations must be taken as soon as it appears that the serious doubts referred to in Article 6 (1) (c) have been removed, particularly as a result of modifications made by the undertakings concerned, and at the latest by the deadline laid down in paragraph 3. 3. Without prejudice to Article 8 (6), decisions taken pursuant to Article 8 (3) concerning notified concentrations must be taken within not more than four months of the date on which the proceeding is initiated. 4. The period set by paragraph 3 shall exceptionally be suspended where, owing to circumstances for which one of the undertakings involved in the concentration is responsible, the Commission has had to request information by decision pursuant to Article 11 or to order an investigation by decision pursuant to Article 13. 5. Where the Court of Justice gives a judgment which annuls the whole or part of a Commission decision taken under this Regulation, the periods laid down in this Regulation shall start again from the date of the judgment. 6. Where the Commission has not taken a decision in accordance with Article 6 (1) (b) or (c) or Article 8 (2) or (3) within the deadlines set in paragraphs 1 and 3 respectively, the concentration shall be deemed declared compatible with the common market, without prejudice to Article 9. Article 11 Requests for information 1. In carrying out the duties assigned to it by this Regulation, the Commission may obtain all necessary information from the Governments and competent authorities of the Member States, from the persons referred to in Article 3 (1) (b), and from undertakings and associations of undertakings. 2. When sending a request for information to a person, an undertaking or an association of undertakings, the Commission shall at the same time send a copy of the request to the competent authority of the Member State within the territory of which the residence of the person or the seat of the undertaking or association of undertakings is situated. 3. In its request the Commission shall state the legal basis and the purpose of the request and also the penalties provided for in Article 14 (1) (b) for supplying incorrect information. 4.

The decision shall specify what information is required, fix an appropriate period within which it is to be supplied and state the penalties provided for in Articles 14 (1) (b) and 15 (1) (a) and the right to have the decision reviewed by the Court of Justice. 6. The Commission shall at the same time send a copy of its decision to the competent authority of the Member State within the territory of which the residence of the person or the seat of the undertaking or association of undertakings is situated. Article 12 Investigations by the authorities of the Member States 1. At the request of the Commission, the competent authorities of the Member States shall undertake the investigations which the Commission considers to be necessary pursuant to Article 13 (1), or which it has ordered by decision pursuant to Article 13 (3). The officials of the competent authorities of the Member States responsible for conducting those investigations shall exercise their powers upon production of an authorization in writing issued by the competent authority of the Member State within the territory of which the investigation is to be carried out. Such authorization shall specify the subject matter and purpose of the investigation. 2.

In good time before the investigation, the Commission shall inform, in writing, the competent authority of the Member State within the territory of which the investigation is to be carried out of the investigation and of the identities of the authorized officials. 3. Undertakings and associations of undertakings shall submit to investigations ordered by decision of the Commission. The decision shall specify the subject matter and purpose of the investigation, appoint the date on which it shall begin and state the penalties provided for in Articles 14 (1) (c) and 15 (1) (b) and the right to have the decision reviewed by the Court of Justice. 4. The Commission shall in good time and in writing inform the competent authority of the Member State within the territory of which the investigation is to be carried out of its intention of taking a decision pursuant to paragraph 3. It shall hear the competent authority before taking its decision. 5. Officials of the competent authority of the Member State within the territory of which the investigation is to be carried out may, at the request of that authority or of the Commission, assist the officials of the Commission in carrying out their duties. 6. Where an undertaking or association of undertakings opposes an investigation ordered pursuant to this Article, the Member State concerned shall afford the necessary assistance to the officials authorized by the Commission to enable them to carry out their investigation.

The Commission may by decision impose on the persons referred to in Article 3 (1) (b), undertakings or associations of undertakings fines of from ECU 1 000 to 50 000 where intentionally or negligently: (a) they omit to notify a concentration in accordance with Article 4; (b) they supply incorrect or misleading information in a notification pursuant to Article 4; (c) they supply incorrect information in response to a request made pursuant to Article 11 or fail to supply information within the period fixed by a decision taken pursuant to Article 11; (d) they produce the required books or other business records in incomplete form during investigations pursuant to Article 12 or 13, or refuse to submit to an investigation ordered by decision taken pursuant to Article 13. 2.

In setting the amount of a fine, regard shall be had to the nature and gravity of the infringement. 4. Decisions taken pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be of a criminal law nature. Article 15 Periodic penalty payments 1.

Article 16 Review by the Court of Justice The Court of Justice shall have unlimited jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 172 of the Treaty to review decisions whereby the Commission has fixed a fine or periodic penalty payments; it may cancel, reduce or increase the fine or periodic penalty payment imposed.

By way of derogation from paragraph 1, a decision to continue the suspension of a concentration or to grant a derogation from suspension as referred to in Article 7 (2) or (4) may be taken provisionally, without the persons, undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned being given the opportunity to make known their views beforehand, provided that the Commission gives them that opportunity as soon as possible after having taken its decision. 3. The Commission shall base its decision only on objections on which the parties have been able to submit their observations. The rights of the defence shall be fully respected in the proceedings. Access to the file shall be open at least to the parties directly involved, subject to the legitimate interest of undertakings in the protection of their business secrets. 4. Insofar as the Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States deem it necessary, they may also hear other natural or legal persons. Natural or legal persons showing a legitimate interest and especially members of the administrative or management organs of the undertakings concerned or recognized workers' representatives of those undertakings shall be entitled, upon application, to be heard. Article 19 Liaison with the authorities of the Member States 1. The Commission shall transmit to the competent authorities of the Member States copies of notifications within three working days and, as soon as possible, copies of the most important documents lodged with or issued by the Commission pursuant to this Regulation. 2. The Commission shall carry out the procedures set out in this Regulation in close and constant liaison with the competent authorities of the Member States, which may express their views upon those procedures. For the purposes of Article 9 it shall obtain information from the competent authority of the Member State as referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article and give it the opportunity to make known its views at every stage of the procedure up to the adoption of a decision pursuant to paragraph 3 of that Article; to that end it shall give it access to the file. 3. An Advisory Committee on concentrations shall be consulted before any decision is taken pursuant to Articles 8 (2) to (5), 14 or 15, or any provisions are adopted pursuant to Article 23. 4.

A summary of the facts, together with the most important documents and a preliminary draft of the decision to be taken for each case considered, shall be sent with the invitation. The meeting shall take place not less than 14 days after the invitation has been sent. The Commission may in exceptional cases shorten that period as appropriate in order to avoid serious harm to one or more of the undertakings concerned by a concentration. 6. The Advisory Committee shall deliver an opinion on the Commission's draft decision, if necessary by taking a vote. The Advisory Committee may deliver an opinion even if some members are absent and unrepresented. The opinion shall be delivered in writing and appended to the draft decision.

Article 21 Jurisdiction1. Subject to review by the Court of Justice, the Commission shall have sole competence to take the decisions provided for in this Regulation. 2. No Member State shall apply its national legislation on competition to any concentration that has a Community dimension. The first subparagraph shall be without prejudice to any Member State's power to carry out any enquiries necessary for the application of Article 9 (2) or after referral, pursuant to Article 9 (3), first subparagraph, indent (b), or (5), to take the measures strictly necessary for the application of Article 9 (8). 3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, Member States may take appropriate measures to protect legitimate interests other than those taken into consideration by this Regulation and compatible with the general principles and other provisions of Community law. Public security, plurality of the media and prudential rules shall be regarded as legitimate interests within the meaning of the first subparagraph. Any other public interest must be communicated to the Commission by the Member State concerned and shall be recognized by the Commission after an assessment of its compatibility with the general principles and other provisions of Community law before the measures referred to above may be taken. The Commission shall inform the Member State concerned of its decision within one month of that communication. Article 22 Application of the Regulation 1. This Regulation alone shall apply to concentrations as defined in Article 3. 2. Regulations No 17 (6), (EEC) No 1017/68 (7), (EEC) No 4056/86 (8) and (EEC) No 3975/87 (9) shall not apply to concentrations as defined in Article 3. 3. If the Commission finds, at the request of a Member State, that a concentration as defined in Article 3 that has no Community dimension within the meaning of Article 1 creates or strengthens a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded within the territory of the Member State concerned it may, insofar as the concentration affects trade between Member States, adopt the decisions provided for in Article 8 (2), second subparagraph, (3) and (4). 4. Articles 2 (1) (a) and (b), 5, 6, 8 and 10 to 20 shall apply. The period within which the proceedings defined in Article 10 (1) may be initiated shall begin on the date of the receipt of the request from the Member State. The request must be made within one month at most of the date on which the concentration was made known to the Member State or effected. This period shall begin on the date of the first of those events. 5. Pursuant to paragraph 3 the Commission shall take only the measures strictly necessary to maintain or restore effective competition within the territory of the Member State at the request of which it intervenes. 6. Paragraphs 3 to 5 shall continue to apply until the thresholds referred to in Article 1 (2) have been reviewed. Article 23 Implementing provisions The Commission shall have the power to adopt implementing provisions concerning the form, content and other details of notifications pursuant to Article 4, time limits pursuant to Article 10, and hearings pursuant to Article 18. Article 24 Relations with non-member countries 1. The Member States shall inform the Commission of any general difficulties encountered by their undertakings with concentrations as defined in Article 3 in a non-member country. 2. Initially not more than one year after the entry into force of this Regulation and thereafter periodically the Commission shall draw up a report examining the treatment accorded to Community undertakings, in the terms referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4, as regards concentrations in non-member countries. The Commission shall submit those reports to the Council, together with any recommendations. 3. Whenever it appears to the Commission, either on the basis of the reports referred to in paragraph 2 or on the basis of other information, that a non-member country does not grant Community undertakings treatment comparable to that granted by the Community to undertakings from that non-member country, the Commission may submit proposals to the Council for the appropriate mandate for negotiation with a view to obtaining comparable treatment for Community undertakings. 4. Measures taken pursuant to this Article shall comply with the obligations of the Community or of the Member States, without prejudice to Article 234 of the Treaty, under international agreements, whether bilateral or multilateral. Article 25 Entry into force 1. This Regulation shall enter into force on 21 September 1990. 2. This Regulation shall not apply to any concentration which was the subject of an agreement or announcement or where control was acquired within the meaning of Article 4 (1) before the date of this Regulation's entry into force and it shall not in any circumstances apply to any concentration in respect of which proceedings were initiated before that date by a Member State's authority with responsibility for competition. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. Done at Brussels, 21 December 1989. For the Council The President E.

If necessary, the Commission shall submit proposals to the Council for the amendment of the list in the Annex.Article 3 Procedures on complaint or on the Commission's own initiative1. Acting on receipt of a complaint or on its own initiative, the Commission shall initiate procedures to terminate any infringement of the provisions of Articles 85 (1) or 86 of the Treaty.Complaints may be submitted by:(a) Member States;(b) natural or legal persons who claim a legitimate interest.2. Upon application by the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned, the Commission may certify that, on the basis of the facts in its possession, there are no grounds under Article 85 (1) or Article 86 of the Treaty for action on its part in respect of an agreement, decision or concerted practice.Article 4 Result of procedures on complaint or on the Commission's own initiative1. Where the Commission finds that there has been an infringement of Articles 85 (1) or 86 of the Treaty, it may by decision require the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned to bring such an infringement to an end.Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Regulation, the Commission may address recommendations for termination of the infringement to the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned before taking a decision under the preceding subparagraph.2. If the Commission, acting on a complaint received, concludes that, on the evidence before it, there are no grounds for intervention under Articles 85 (1) or 86 of the Treaty in respect of any agreement, decision or concerted practice, it shall take a decision rejecting the complaint as unfounded.3. If the Commission, whether acting on a complaint received or on its own initiative, concludes that an agreement, decision or concerted practice satisfies the provisions of both Article 85 (1) and 85 (3) of the Treaty, it shall take a decision applying paragraph 3 of the said Article.

The autonomous and conventional rates of duty of the Common Customs Tariff and the supplementary statistical units, as well as other necessary information, are laid down in the said Annex. Article 2 The Commission shall establish an integrated tariff, of the European Communities, hereinafter referred to as the Taric, based on the combined nomenclature. It shall comprise: (a) additional Community subdivisions, referred to as Taric subheadings, which are needed for the description of goods subject to the specific Community measures listed in Annex II; (b) the rates of customs duty and other charges applicable; (c) the code numbers mentioned in Article 3 (3) and (4); (d) any other information necessary for the implementation or management of the Community measures involved.

When a heading or subheading of the harmonized system is not further subdivided for Community purposes, the seventh and eight digits shall be 00. 2. The ninth digit shall be reserved for the use of the Member States for national statistical subdivisions, to be inserted in accordance with Article 5 (3). 3. The Taric subheadings shall be identified by the 10th and 11th digits which, together with the code numbers referred to in paragraph 1, form the Taric code numbers. In the absence of a Community subdivision, the 10th and 11th digits shall be 00. 4.

They shall, where necessary, be applied to exports and to trade between Member States. 3. Member States may insert subdivisions after the CN subheadings for national statistical purposes, and after the Taric subheadings for other national purposes. Identifying code numbers shall be assigned to such subdivisions in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2793/86. 4.

These arrangements shall be based on the contract system or any other system which is also lawful. Loyalty arrangements must comply with the following conditions: (a)Each conference shall offer transport users a system of immediate rebates or the choice between such a system and a system of deferred rebates: -under the system of immediate rebates each of the parties shall be entitled to terminate the loyalty arrangement at any time without penalty and subject to a period of notice of not more than six months; this period shall be reduced to three months when the conference rate is the subject of a dispute; -under the system of deferred rebates neither the loyalty period on the basis of which the rebate is calculated nor the subsequent loyalty period required before payment of the rebate may exceed six months; this period shall be reduced to three months where the conference rate is the subject of a dispute. (b)The conference shall, after consulting the transport users concerned, set out: i(i)a list of cargo and any portion of cargo agreed with transport users which is specifically excluded from the scope of the loyalty arrangement; 100 % loyalty arrangements may be offered but may not be unilaterally imposed; (ii)a list of circumstances in which transport users are released from their obligation of loyalty; these shall include: -circumstances in which consignments are dispatched from or to a port in the area covered by the conference but not advertised and where the request for a waiver can be justified, and-those in which waiting time at a port exceeds a period to be determined for each port and for each commodity or class of commodities following consultation of the transport users directly concerned with the proper servicing of the port. The conference must, however, be informed in advance by the transport user, within a specified period, of his intention to dispatch the consignment from a port not advertised by the conference or to make use of a non-conference vessel at a port served by the conference as soon as he has been able to establish from the published schedule of sailings that the maximum waiting period will be exceeded. 3.

Effects incompatible with Article 85 (3)(a)Where, owing to special circumstances as described below, agreements, decisions and concerted practices which qualify for the exemption provided for in Articles 3 and 6 have nevertheless effects which are incompatible with the conditions laid down in Article 85 (3) of the Treaty, the Commission, on receipt of a complaint or on its own initiative, under the conditions laid down in Section II, shall take the measures described in (c) below. The severity of these measures must be in proportion to the gravity of the situation. (b)Special circumstances are, inter alia, created by: ii(i)acts of conferences or a change of market conditions in a given trade resulting in the absence or elimination of actual or potential competition such as restrictive practices whereby the trade is not available to competition; ori(ii)acts of conference which may prevent technical or economic progress or user participation in the benefits; (iii)acts of third countries which: - prevent the operation of outsiders in a trade, - impose unfair tariffs on conference members, - impose arrangements which otherwise impede technical or economic progress (cargo-sharing, limitations on types of vessels). (c)ii(i)If actual or potential competition is absent or may be eliminated as a result of action by a third country, the Commission shall enter into consultations with the competent authorities of the third country concerned, followed if necessary by negotiations under directives to be given by the Council, in order to remedy the situation. If the special circumstances result in the absence or elimination of actual or potential competition contrary to Article 85 (3) (b) of the Treaty the Commission shall withdraw the benefit of the block exemption. At the same time it shall rule on whether and, if so, under what additional conditions and obligations an individual exemption should be granted to the relevant conference agreement with a view, inter alia, to obtaining access to the market for non-conference lines; i(ii)If, as a result of special circumstances as set out in (b), there are effects other than those referred to in (i) hereof, the Commission shall take one or more of the measures described in paragraph 1. Article 8Effects incompatible with Article 86 of the Treaty1. The abuse of a dominant position within the meaning of Article 86 of the Treaty shall be prohibited, no prior decision to that effect being required. 2. Where the Commission, either on its own initiative or at the request of a Member State or of natural or legal persons claiming a legitimate interest, finds that in any particular case the conduct of conferences benefiting from the exemption laid down in Article 3 nevertheless has effects which are incompatible with Article 86 of the Treaty, it may withdraw the benefit of the block exemption and take, pursuant to Article 10, all appropriate measures for the purpose of bringing to an end infringements of Article 86 of the Treaty. 3. Before taking a decision under paragraph 2, the Commission may address to the conference concerned recommendations for termination of the infringement. Article 9Conflicts of international law1.

The documents and particulars referred to in (c) may be published either in full or in extract form or by means of a reference to their filing at the registry, in accordance with the national legislation applicable. Article 9 1. The documents and particulars which must be published pursuant to this Regulation may be relied on by a grouping as against third parties under the conditions laid down by the national law applicable pursuant to Article 3 (5) and (7) of Council Directive 68/151/EEC of 9 March 1968 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community (4). 2. If activities have been carried on on behalf of a grouping before its registration in accordance with Article 6 and if the grouping does not, after its registration, assume the obligations arising out of such activities, the natural persons, companies, firms or other legal bodies which carried on those activities shall bear unlimited joint and several liability for them. Article 10 Any grouping establishment situated in a Member State other than that in which the official address is situated shall be registered in that State. For the purpose of such registration, a grouping shall file, at the appropriate registry in that Member State, copies of the documents which must be filed at the registry of the Member State in which the official address is situated, together, if necessary, with a translation which conforms with the practice of the registry where the establishment is registered. Article 11 Notice that a grouping has been formed or that the liquidation of a grouping has been concluded stating the number, date and place of registration and the date, place and title of publication, shall be given in the Official Journal of the European Communities after it has been published in the gazette referred to in Article 39 (1). Article 12 The official address referred to in the contract for the formation of a grouping must be situated in the Community. The official address must be fixed either: (a) where the grouping has its central administration, or (b) where one of the members of the grouping has its central administration or, in the case of a natural person, his principal activity, provided that the grouping carries on an activity there. Article 13 The official address of a grouping may be transferred within the Community. When such a transfer does not result in a change in the law applicable pursuant to Article 2, the decision to transfer shall be taken in accordance with the conditions laid down in the contract for the formation of the grouping. Article 14 1. When the transfer of the official address results in a change in the law applicable pursuant to Article 2, a transfer proposal must be drawn up, filed and published in accordance with the conditions laid down in Articles 7 and 8. No decision to transfer may be taken for two months after publication of the proposal. Any such decision must be taken by the members of the grouping unanimously. The transfer shall take effect on the date on which the grouping is registered, in accordance with Article 6, at the registry for the new official address. That registration may not be effected until evidence has been produced that the proposal to transfer the official address has been published. 2. The termination of a grouping's registration at the registry for its old official address may not be effected until evidence has been produced that the grouping has been registered at the registry for its new official address. 3. Upon publication of a grouping's new registration the new official address may be relied on as against third parties in accordance with the conditions referred to in Article 9 (1); however, as long as the termination of the grouping's registration at the registry for the old official address has not been published, third parties may continue to rely on the old official address unless the grouping proves that such third parties were aware of the new official address. 4. The laws of a Member State may provide that, as regards groupings registered under Article 6 in that Member State, the transfer of an official address which would result in a change of the law applicable shall not take effect if, within the two-month period referred to in paragraph 1, a competent authority in that Member State opposes it. Such opposition may be based only on grounds of public interest. Review by a judicial authority must be possible. Article 15 1. Where the law applicable to a grouping by virtue of Article 2 provides for the nullity of that grouping, such nullity must be established or declared by judicial decision. However, the court to which the matter is referred must, where it is possible for the affairs of the grouping to be put in order, allow time to permit that to be done. 2. The nullity of a grouping shall entail its liquidation in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 35. 3. A decision establishing or declaring the nullity of a grouping may be relied on as against third parties in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 9 (1). Such a decision shall not of itself affect the validity of liabilities, owed by or to a grouping, which originated before it could be relied on as against third parties in accordance with the conditions laid down in the previous subparagraph. Article 16 1. The organs of a grouping shall be the members acting collectively and the manager or managers. A contract for the formation of a grouping may provide for other organs; if it does it shall determine their powers. 2. The members of a grouping, acting as a body, may take any decision for the purpose of achieving the objects of the grouping. Article 17 1. Each member shall have one vote. The contract for the formation of a grouping may, however, give more than one vote to certain members, provided that no one member holds a majority of the votes. 2. A unanimous decision by the members shall be required to: (a) alter the objects of a grouping; (b) alter the number of votes allotted to each member; (c) alter the conditions for the taking of decisions; (d) extend the duration of a grouping beyond any period fixed in the contract for the formation of the grouping; (e) alter the contribution by every member or by some members to the grouping's financing; (f) alter any other obligation of a member, unless otherwise provided by the contract for the formation of the grouping; (g) make any alteration to the contract for the formation of the grouping not covered by this paragraph, unless otherwise provided by that contract. 3. Except where this Regulation provides that decisions must be taken unanimously, the contract for the formation of a grouping may prescribe the conditions for a quorum and for a majority, in accordance with which the decisions, or some of them, shall be taken. Unless otherwise provided for by the contract, decisions shall be taken unanimously. 4. On the initiative of a manager or at the request of a member, the manager or managers must arrange for the members to be consulted so that the latter can take a decision. Article 18 Each member shall be entitled to obtain information from the manager or managers concerning the grouping's business and to inspect the grouping's books and business records. Article 19 1. A grouping shall be managed by one or more natural persons appointed in the contract for the formation of the grouping or by decision of the members. No person may be a manager of a grouping if:  by virtue of the law applicable to him, or  by virtue of the internal law of the State in which the grouping has its official address, or  following a judicial or administrative decision made or recognized in a Member State he may not belong to the administrative or management body of a company, may not manage an undertaking or may not act as manager of a European Economic Interest Grouping. 2. A Member State may, in the case of groupings registered at their registries pursuant to Article 6, provide that legal persons may be managers on condition that such legal persons designate one or more natural persons, whose particulars shall be the subject of the filing provisions of Article 7 (d) to represent them. If a Member State exercises this option, it must provide that the representative or representatives shall be liable as if they were themselves managers of the groupings concerned. The restrictions imposed in paragraph 1 shall also apply to those representatives. 3. The contract for the formation of a grouping or, failing that, a unanimous decision by the members shall determine the conditions for the appointment and removal of the manager or managers and shall lay down their powers. Article 20 1. Only the manager or, where there are two or more, each of the managers shall represent a grouping in respect of dealings with third parties. Each of the managers shall bind the grouping as regards third parties when he acts on behalf of the grouping, even where his acts do not fall within the objects of the grouping, unless the grouping proves that the third party knew or could not, under the circumstances, have been unaware that the act fell outside the objects of the grouping; publication of the particulars referred to in Article 5 (c) shall not of itself be proof thereof. No limitation on the powers of the manager or managers, whether deriving from the contract for the formation of the grouping or from a decision by the members, may be relied on as against thrid parties even if it is published. 2. The contract for the formation of the grouping may provide that the grouping shall be validly bound only by two or more managers acting jointly. Such a clause may be relied on as against third parties in accordance with the conditions referred to in Article 9 (1) only if it is published in accordance with Article 8. Article 21 1. The profits resulting from a grouping's activities shall be deemed to be the profits of the members and shall be apportioned among them in the proportions laid down in the contract for the formation of the grouping or, in the absence of any such provision, in equal shares. 2. The members of a grouping shall contribute to the payment of the amount by which expenditure exceeds income in the proportions laid down in the contract for the formation of the grouping or, in the absence of any such provision, in equal shares. Article 22 1. Any member of a grouping may assign his participation in the grouping, or a proportion thereof, either to another member or to a third party; the assignment shall not take effect without the unanimous authorization of the other members. 2. A member of a grouping may use his participation in the grouping as security only after the other members have given their unanimous authorization, unless otherwise laid down in the contract for the formation of the grouping. The holder of the security may not at any time become a member of the grouping by virtue of that security. Article 23 No grouping may invite investment by the public. Article 24 1. The members of a grouping shall have unlimited joint and several liability for its debts and other liabilities of whatever nature. National law shall determine the consequences of such liablity. 2. Creditors may not proceed against a member for payment in respect of debts and other liabilities, in accordance with the conditions laid down in paragraph 1, before the liquidation of a grouping is concluded, unless they have first requested the grouping to pay and payment has not been made within an appropriate period. Article 25 Letters, order forms and similar documents must indicate legibly: (a) the name of the grouping preceded or followed either by the words European Economic Interest Grouping or by the initials EEIG, unless those words or initials already occur in the name; (b) the location of the registry referred to in Article 6, in which the grouping is registered, together with the number of the grouping's entry at the registry; (c) the grouping's official address; (d) where applicable, that the managers must act jointly; (e) where applicable, that the grouping is in liquidation, pursuant to Articles 15, 31, 32 or 36. Every establishment of a grouping, when registered in accordance with Article 10, must give the above particulars, together with those relating to its own registration, on the documents referred to in the first paragraph of this Article uttered by it. Article 26 1. A decision to admit new members shall be taken unanimously by the members of the grouping. 2. Every new member shall be liable, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 24, for the grouping's debts and other liabilities, including those arising out of the grouping's activities before his admission. He may, however, be exempted by a clause in the contract for the formation of the grouping or in the instrument of admission from the payment of debts and other liabilities which originated before his admission. Such a clause may be relied on as against third parties, under the conditions referred to in Article 9 (1), only if it is published in accordance with Article 8. Article 27 1. A member of a grouping may withdraw in accordance with the conditions laid down in the contract for the formation of a grouping or, in the absence of such conditions, with the unanimous agreement of the other members. Any member of a grouping may, in addition, withdraw on just and proper grounds. 2. Any member of a grouping may be expelled for the reasons listed in the contract for the formation of the grouping and, in any case, if he seriously fails in his obligations or if he causes or threatens to cause serious disruption in the operation of the grouping. Such expulsion may occur only by the decision of a court to which joint application has been made by a majority of the other members, unless otherwise provided by the contract for the formation of a grouping. Article 28 1. A member of a grouping shall cease to belong to it on death or when he no longer complies with the conditions laid down in Article 4 (1). In addition, a Member State may provide, for the purposes of its liquidation, winding up, insolvency or cessation of payments laws, that a member shall cease to be a member of any grouping at the moment determined by those laws. 2. In the event of the death of a natural person who is a member of a grouping, no person may become a member in his place except under the conditions laid down in the contract for the formation of the grouping or, failing that, with the unanimous agreement of the remaining members. Article 29 As soon as a member ceases to belong to a grouping, the manager or managers must inform the other members of that fact; they must also take the steps required as listed in Articles 7 and 8. In addition, any person concerned may take those steps. Article 30 Except where the contract for the formation of a grouping provides otherwise and without prejudice to the rights acquired by a person under Articles 22 (1) or 28 (2), a grouping shall continue to exist for the remaining members after a member has ceased to belong to it, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the contract for the formation of the grouping or determined by unanimous decision of the members in question. Article 31 1. A grouping may be wound up by a decision of its members ordering its winding up. Such a decision shall be taken unanimously, unless otherwise laid down in the contract for the formation of the grouping. 2. A grouping must be wound up by a decision of its members: (a) noting the expiry of the period fixed in the contract for the formation of the grouping or the existence of any other cause for winding up provided for in the contract, or (b) noting the accomplishment of the grouping's purpose or the impossibility of pursuing it further. Where, three months after one of the situation referred to in the first subparagraph has occurred, a members' decision establishing the winding up of the grouping has not been taken, any member may petition the court to order winding up. 3. A grouping must also be wound up by a decision of its members or of the remaining member when the conditions laid down in Article 4 (2) are no longer fulfilled. 4. After a grouping has been wound up by decision of its members, the manager or managers must take the steps required as listed in Articles 7 and 8. In addition, any person concerned may take those steps. Article 32 1. On application by any person concerned or by a competent authority, in the event of the infringement of Articles 3, 12 or 31 (3), the court must order a grouping to be wound up, unless its affairs can be and are put in order before the court has delivered a substantive ruling. 2. On applications by a member, the court may order a grouping to be wound up on just and proper grounds. 3. A Member State may provide that the court may, on application by a competent authority, order the winding up of a grouping which has its official address in the State to which that authority belongs, wherever the grouping acts in contravention of that State's public interest, if the law of that State provides for such a possibility in respect of registered companies or other legal bodies subject to it. Article 33 When a member ceases to belong to a grouping for any reason other than the assignment of his rights in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 22 (1), the value of his rights and obligations shall be determined taking into account the assets and liabilities of the grouping as they stand when he ceases to belong to it. The value of the rights and obligations of a departing member may not be fixed in advance. Article 34 Without prejudice to Article 37 (1), any member who ceases to belong to a grouping shall remain answerable, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 24, for the debts and other liabilities arising out of the grouping's activities before he ceased to be a member. Article 35 1. The winding up of a grouping shall entail its liquidation. 2. The liquidation of a grouping and the conclusion of its liquidation shall be governed by national law. 3. A grouping shall retain its capacity, within the meaning of Article 1 (2), until its liquidation is concluded. 4. The liquidator or liquidators shall take the steps required as listed in Articles 7 and 8. Article 36 Groupings shall be subject to national laws governing insolvency and cessation of payments. The commencement of proceedings against a grouping on grounds of its insolvency or cessation of payments shall not by itself cause the commencement of such proceedings against its members. Article 37 1. A period of limitation of five years after the publication, pursuant to Article 8, of notice of a member's ceasing to belong to a grouping shall be substituted for any longer period which may be laid down by the relevant national law for actions against that member in connection with debts and other liabilities arising out of the grouping's activities before he ceased to be a member. 2. A period of limitation of five years after the publication, pursuant to Article 8, of notice of the conclusion of the liquidation of a grouping shall be substituted for any longer period which may be laid down by the relevant national law for actions against a member of the grouping in connection with debts and other liabilities arising out of the grouping's activities.

"103","31983R0170","Article 1 shall be formulated in the light of the available scientific advice and, in particular, of the report prepared by the Scientific and Technical Committee for Fisheries provided for in Article 12.2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 may include, in particular,for each species or group of species:(a) the establishment of zones where fishing is prohibited or restricted to certain periods, types of vessel, fishing gear or certain end-uses;(b) the setting of standards as regards fishing gear;(c) the setting of a minimum fish size or weight per species;(d) the restriction of fishing effort, in particular by limits on catches.Article 3Where, in the case of one species or a group of related species, it becomes necessary to limit the catch, the total allowable catch for each stock or group of stocks, the shares available to the Community as well as, where applicable, the total catch allocated to third countries, and the specific conditions for taking these catches, shall be fixed each year.The shares available referred to in the first subparagraph shall be increased by the total of Community catches outside the waters under thejurisdiction or sovereignty of the Member States.Article 41. The volume of the catches available to the Community referred to in Article 3 shall be distributed between the Member States in a manner which assures each Member State relative stability of fishing activities for each of the stocks considered.2. On the basis of the contents of the report referred to in Article 8,the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the Treaty, shall enact provisions effecting the adjustments that it may prove necessary to make to the distribution of the resources among Member States in consequence of the application of paragraph 1.Article 51.

For species of special importance in the region referred to in Annex II (A) which are biologically sensitive because of their exploitation characteristics, fishing activities will be governed by a licensing system managed by the Commission on behalf of the Community.2. Vessels which comply with the minimum characteristics laid down in Annex II (C) and which exercise their activity on the species specifiedin Annex II (B) shall be subject to the system referred to in paragraph 1.Where the fishing effort of vessels which do not comply with the minimum characteristics provided for in the first subparagraph is likely tojeopardize the satisfactory development of the stocks concerned as a resultof a significant increase in such activity as compared with that carried out on the date of entry into force of this Regulation, the minimum characteristics specified in Annex II (C) may be reduced or specific measures adopted to monitor such activity.3. For each Member State, the number of vessels referred to in the firstsubparagraph of paragraph 2 which may exercise their activity simultaneously is specified in Annex II (D).

Implementation of Article 12 of the Regulation Article 7 General rules for the implementation of provisions dealing with the prevention of overlapping of benefits - Application of those provisions to benefits in respect of invalidity, old age and death (pensions) 1. Where a person entitled to a benefit due under the legislation of one Member State is also entitled to benefits under the legislation of one or more of the other Member States, the following rules shall apply: (a) if the application of Article 12 (2) or (3) of the Regulation entails the reduction or the concurrent suspension of those benefits, none of them may be reduced or suspended by an amount greater than the amount obtained by dividing the sum which is subject to reduction or suspension under the legislation under which the benefit is due by the number of benefits subject to reduction or suspension to which the person concerned is entitled; (b) as regards benefits in respect of invalidity, old age or death (pensions) awarded under Article 46 (2) of the Regulation by the institution of a Member State, that institution shall take into account any benefits of a different kind and any income or remuneration likely to entail the reduction or suspension of the benefit due from that institution, not for the calculation of the theoretical amount referred to in Article 46 (2) (a) of the Regulation but exclusively for the reduction or suspension of the amount referred to in Article 46 (2) (b) of the Regulation. However, only a fraction of the total amount of such benefit, income or remuneration shall be taken into account, and that fraction shall be determined in proportion to the duration of the insurance periods completed, in accordance with Article 46 (2) (b) of the Regulation. (c) As regards benefits in respect of invalidity, old age or death (pensions) awarded under the first subparagraph of Article 46 (1) of the Regulation by the institution of a Member State, that institution shall, where the provisions of Article 46 (3) of the Regulation apply, take into account any benefits of a different kind and any income or remuneration likely to entail the reduction or suspension of the benefit due from that institution, not for the calculation of the amount referred to in Article 46 (1) of the Regulation, but exclusively for the reduction or suspension of the amount resulting from the application of Article 46 (3) of the Regulation. However, only a fraction of the amount of those benefits, income or remuneration shall be taken into account; such fraction shall be obtained by applying to that amount a coefficient equal to the ratio between the amount of benefit resulting from the application of Article 46 (3) of the Regulation and the amount resulting from the application of the first subparagraph of Article 46 (1) of the Regulation. 2. For the purposes of Article 12 (2), (3) and (4) of the Regulation, the competent institutions concerned shall, on request, exchange all requisite information.

Article 9 Rules applicable in the case of overlapping of rights to death grants under the legislations of several Member States 1. Where the death occurs in the territory of a Member State, the right to a death grant acquired under the legislation of that Member State only shall be maintained, whilst the right acquired under the legislation of any other Member State shall lapse. 2. Where the death occurs in the territory of one Member State when the right to a death grant has been acquired under the legislation of two or more other Member States, or where the death occurs outside the territory of the Member States and the said right has been acquired under the legislation of two or more Member States, only the right acquired under the legislation of the Member State under which the worker completed his last period of insurance shall be maintained, whilst the right acquired under the legislation of any other Member State shall lapse. Article 10 Rules applicable in the case of overlapping of rights to family benefits or family allowances or when, during the same period or part of a period, the worker is successively subject to the legislation of several Member States 1.

To this end, the right to family benefits or family allowances under Article 73 (1) or (2) or Article 74 (1) or (2) of the Regulation shall be taken into account as if it were a right acquired under the legislation of the country of residence of the member of the family in question. 2. If a worker has been subject successively to the legislation of two Member States during the period separating two dates for the payment of family benefits or family allowances as provided for by the legislation of one or both of the Member States concerned, the following rules shall apply: (a) the family benefits or family allowances which such worker may claim under the legislation of each one of these States shall correspond to the number of daily benefits or allowances due under the relevant legislation. Where these legislations do not provide for daily benefits or allowances, the family benefits or family allowances shall be granted in proportion to the length of time during which such worker has been subject to the legislation of each one of the Member States in relation to the period fixed by the legislation concerned; (b) where the family benefits or family allowances have been provided by an institution during a period when they should have been provided by another institution, there shall be an adjustment of accounts between the said institutions; (c) for the purposes of subparagraphs (a) and (b) where periods of employment completed under the legislation of one Member State are expressed in units different from those which are used in the calculation of family benefits or family allowances under the legislation of another Member State to which the worker has also been subject during the same period, the conversion shall be carried out in accordance with Article 15 (3) of the Implementing Regulation; (d) notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a), in respect of dealings between the Member States specified in Annex 8 to the Implementing Regulation, the institution bearing the costs of the family benefits or family allowances by reason of the first employment during the period concerned, shall bear their cost throughout the whole of the current period. 3.

Where benefits in respect of invalidity, old age or death (pensions) are to be awarded by the institutions of two or more Member States in accordance with Article 46 (2) of the Regulation, each of the institutions concerned shall effect a separate aggregation, by taking into account the whole of the insurance periods completed by the worker under the legislations of all the Member States to which he has been subject, without prejudice, where appropriate, to the provisions of Article 45 (2) and Article 46 (2) (c) of the Regulation; (b) when a period of compulsory insurance completed under the legislation of one Member State coincides with a period of voluntary or optional continued insurance under the legislation of another Member State, only the former shall be taken into account; (c) when an insurance period other than a period treated as such, completed under the legislation of one Member State coincides with a period treated as an insurance period under the legislation of another Member State, only the former shall be taken into account; (d) any period treated as an insurance period under the legislations of two or more Member States, shall be taken into account only by the institution of the Member State under whose legislation the insured person was last compulsorily insured prior to the said period; where the insured person has not been compulsorily insured under the legislation of a Member State before the said period, the latter shall be taken into account by the institution of the Member State under whose legislation he was compulsorily insured for the first time after the said period; (e) where it is not possible to accurately determine the period of time in which certain insurance periods were completed under the legislation of one Member State, such insurance periods shall be presumed not to overlap with insurance periods completed under the legislation of another Member State and shall, where advantageous, be taken into account. (f) where, under the legislation of one Member State, certain insurance periods are taken into account only if they have been completed within a specified period of time, the institution which administers such legislation shall: (i) take into account insurance periods completed under the legislation of another Member State only if they were completed within the said period of time; or (ii) extend such period of time for the duration of insurance periods completed wholly or partly within the said time limit under the legislation of another Member State, where the insurance periods involved under legislation of the second Member State give rise only to the suspension of the period of time within which the insurance periods must be completed. 2. Insurance periods completed under legislation of a Member State to which the Regulation does not apply, but which are taken into account under legislation of that Member State to which the Regulation does apply, shall be considered as insurance periods to be taken into account for the purposes of aggregation. 3. When insurance periods completed under the legislation of one Member State are expressed in units different from those used by the legislation of another Member State, the conversion necessary for the purposes of aggregation shall be carried out according to the following rules: (a) where the worker has been subject to a six day week: (i) one day shall be equivalent to eight hours and vice versa; (ii) six days shall be equivalent to one week and vice versa; (iii) twenty-six days shall be equivalent to one month and vice versa; (iv) three months or thirteen weeks or seventy-eight days shall be equivalent to one quarter and vice versa; (v) for the conversion of weeks into months and vice versa the weeks and months shall be converted into days; (vi) the application of the preceding rules shall not have the effect of producing, for the sum total of the insurance periods completed during one calendar year, a total exceeding three hundred and twelve days or fifty-two weeks or twelve months or four quarters; (b) Where the worker has been subject to a five day week: (i) one day shall be equivalent to nine hours and vice versa; (ii) five days shall be equivalent to one week and vice versa; (iii) twenty-two days shall be equivalent to one month and vice versa; (iv) three months or thirteen weeks or sixty-six days shall be equivalent to one quarter and vice versa; (v) for the conversion of weeks into months and vice versa, the weeks and the months shall be converted into days; (vi) the application of the preceding rules shall not have the effect of producing, for the sum total of the insurance periods completed during one calendar year, a total exceeding two-hundred and sixty-four days or fifty-two weeks or twelve months or four quarters.

Such certified statement shall be issued by the competent institution, if need be in the light of information furnished by the employer. If the worker or the members of his family do not submit the said certified statement the institution of the place of residence shall obtain it directly from the competent institution. 2. This certified statement shall remain valid until the institution of the place of residence is notified of its cancellation. However, when the said certified statement is issued by a French institution, it shall be valid for a period of three months only following the date of issue, and it must be renewed every three months. 3.

The worker or the members of his family shall inform the institution of the place of residence of any change in their situation which is likely to alter their entitlement to benefits in kind, in particular any cessation of, or change in, employment by the worker or any transfer of residence or stay of that worker or of a member of his family. Likewise, should the worker cease to be insured or cease to be entitled to benefits in kind, the competent institution shall inform the institution of the place of residence accordingly. The institution of the place of residence may, at any time, request the competent institution to supply it with any information relating to the worker's insurance or to his entitlement to benefits in kind. 9.

Article 37 Documents and information which should accompany claims to the benefits referred to in Article 36 of the implementing Regulation The submission of the claims under Article 36 of the Implementing Regulation shall be subject to the following rules: (a) the claim must be accompanied by the requisite supporting documents and must be drawn up on the form provided for by the legislation, (i) of the Member State in whose territory the claimant resides, in the case referred to in Article 36 (1); (ii) of the Member State to which the worker was last subject, in the cases referred to in Article 36 (2) and (3); (b) the accuracy of the information supplied by the claimant must be proved by official documents attached to the claim form, or confirmed by the competent bodies of the Member State in whose territory the claimant resides; (c) the claimant must indicate, in so far as is possible, either the institution or institutions administering insurance in respect of invalidity, old age or death (pensions) of any Member State with which the worker has been insured, or the employer or employers for whom he has worked in the territory of any Member State, by producing any employment certificates which he may have in his possession; (d) if, under Article 44 (2) of the Regulation, the claimant asks for the postponement of the award of any old age benefits to which he would be entitled under the legislation of one or more Member States he may specify the legislation under which he is claiming benefits. Article 38 Certified statements relating to the members of the family to be taken into account when establishing the amount of the benefit 1. In order to draw benefits under Article 39 (4) or Article 47 (3) of the Regulation, the claimant shall submit a certified statement relating to the members of his family, his children excepted, who are residing in the territory of a Member State other than that in which the institution responsible for the award of benefits is situated. This certified statement shall be issued by the sickness insurance institution of the place of residence of the members of the family, or by another institution designated by the competent authority of the Member State in whose territory they are resident. The second and third subparagraphs of Article 25 (2) of the Implementing Regulation shall apply by analogy. In place of the certified statement provided for in the first paragraph, the institution responsible for the award of benefits may require the claimant to supply recent civil status documents relating to the members of his family, his children excepted, who are residing in the territory of a Member State other than the State in which the said institution is situated. 2. In the case referred to in paragraph 1, if the legislation administered by the institution in question requires that the members of the family should live under the same roof as the pensioner, the fact that such members of the family who do not satisfy that condition are, nevertheless, mainly dependent on the claimant must be established by documents proving that the claimant is regularly sending them a part of his earnings. Article 39 Investigation of claims for invalidity benefits in the case where the worker has been insured exclusively under the legislations specified in Annex III of the Regulation 1. If a worker has submitted a claim for invalidity benefits, and the institution establishes that the provisions of Article 37 (1) of the Regulation apply, that institution shall, where necessary, obtain from the institution with which the worker was last insured a certified statement of the insurance periods completed by him under the legislation administered by that last institution. 2. Where it is necessary to take into account insurance periods previously completed under the legislation of any other Member State in order to satisfy the conditions of the legislation of the competent State, the provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply by analogy. 3. In the case referred to in Article 39 (3) of the Regulation, the institution which has investigated the claimant's case shall forward his file to the institution with which the worker was last insured. 4. Articles 41 to 50 of the Implementing Regulation shall not apply to the investigation of claims referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. Article 40 Determination of the degree of invalidity In order to determine the degree of invalidity, the institution of the Member State shall take into consideration the documents and medical reports and the information of an administrative nature obtained by the institution of any other Member State. Each institution shall, however, retain the right to have the claimant examined by a doctor of its own choice except where Article 40 (3) of the Regulation applies. Investigation of claims for benefits in respect of invalidity, old age and survivors in the cases referred to in Article 36 of the Implementing Regulation Article 41 Determination of the investigating institution 1. Claims for benefit shall be investigated by the institution (hereinafter called the 'investigating institution') to which they have been sent or forwarded in accordance with Article 36 of the Implementing Regulation. 2. The investigating institution shall forthwith notify claims for benefits to all the institutions concerned on a special form, so that the claims may be investigated simultaneously and without delay by all these institutions. Article 42 Forms to be used for the investigation of claims for benefits 1. When investigating claims for benefits, the investigating institution shall use a form which will include, in particular, a statement and a summary of the insurance periods completed by the worker under the legislations of all the Member States concerned. 2. These forms, when forwarded to the institution of any other Member State, shall take the place of supporting documents. Article 43 Procedure to be followed by the institutions concerned in the investigation of a claim 1. The investigating institution shall enter on the form provided for in Article 42 (1) of the Implementing Regulation the insurance periods completed under the legislation which it administers and it shall forward a copy of that form to the institution administering insurance in respect of invalidity, old age or death (pensions) of any Member State with which the worker has been insured enclosing, where appropriate, any employment certificates produced by the claimant. 2. Where only one other institution is involved, that institution shall complete the said form by indicating: (a) the insurance periods completed under the legislation which it administers; (b) the amount of benefit which the claimant could claim in respect of those insurance periods only; (c) the theoretical amount and the actual amount of benefits calculated in accordance with Article 46 (2) of the Regulation. The form, thus completed, shall be returned to the investigating institution. If a right to benefits is acquired taking into account only the insurance periods completed under the legislation administered by the institution of the second Member State, and if the amount of benefit corresponding to those insurance periods can be established without delay, whereas the calculation procedure referred to in (c) requires an appreciably longer period of time, the form shall be returned to the investigating institution with the information referred to in (a) and (b); the information referred to in (c) shall be forwarded to the investigating institution as soon as possible. 3. If two or more other institutions are involved, each one of those institutions shall complete the said form by indicating the insurance periods completed under the legislation which it administers, and shall return it to the investigating institution. If a right to benefit is acquired taking into account only the insurance periods completed under the legislation administered by one or more of those institutions, and if the amount of benefit corresponding to those insurance periods can be determined without delay, the investigating institution shall be simultaneously notified of that amount and of the insurance periods; if the determination of the amount involves some delay, the investigating institution shall be notified of that amount as soon as it has been determined. On receipt of all the forms giving information concerning insurance periods and, where applicable, the amount or amounts due under the legislation of one or more of the Member States concerned, the investigating institution shall forward a copy of the forms thus completed to each one of the institutions concerned; each such institution shall specify thereon the theoretical amount and the actual amount of the benefits, calculated in accordance with Article 46 (2) of the Regulation, and shall return the form to the investigating institution. 4. As soon as the investigating institution, upon receipt of the information referred to in paragraphs 2 or 3, establishes the fact that Articles 40 (2) or 48 (2) or (3) of the Regulation should be applied, it shall inform the other institutions concerned accordingly. 5. In the case provided for in Article 37 (d) of the Implementing Regulation, the institutions of the Member States to whose legislation the claimant has been subject but to whom he has applied for postponement of the award of the benefits, shall enter on the form provided for in Article 42 (1) of the Implementing Regulation only the insurance periods completed by the claimant under the legislation which they administer. Article 44 Institution empowered to take a decision relating to the degree of invalidity 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, only the investigating institution shall be empowered to take the decision referred to in Article 40 (3) of the Regulation concerning the degree of invalidity of the claimant. It shall take such a decision as soon as it is in a position to determine whether, taking account, where appropriate, of Article 45 of the Regulation, the conditions for entitlement fixed by the legislation which it administers are fulfilled. It shall notify such decision forthwith to the other institutions concerned. 2. If, taking account of the provisions of Article 45 of the Regulation, the conditions for entitlement (other than those relating to the degree of invalidity) fixed by the legislation administered by the investigating institution are not fulfilled, it shall notify this to the institution competent in respect of invalidity of that one to whose legislation the worker was last subject. This institution shall, if the conditions for entitlement fixed by the legislation which it administers are fulfilled, be empowered to take the decision relating to the degree of invalidity of the claimant and shall forthwith notify that decision to the other institutions concerned. 3. Where necessary, the matter may be referred back, under the same conditions, to the institution competent in respect of invalidity of the Member State to whose legislation the worker was first subject. Article 45 Provisional payment of benefits, and advance payments of benefits 1. If the investigating institution establishes that the claimant is entitled to benefits under the legislation which it administers without having recourse to insurance periods completed under the legislation of other Member States, it shall pay such benefits immediately on a provisional basis. 2. If the claimant is not entitled to benefits under paragraph 1 but, from information supplied to the investigating institution pursuant to Article 43 (2) or (3) of the Implementing Regulation, it transpires that a right to benefits is acquired under the legislation of another Member State taking into account only the insurance periods completed under that legislation, the institution which administers the said legislation shall pay such benefits on a provisional basis as soon as the investigating institution has informed it of its obligation to do so. 3. If, in the case referred to in paragraph 2, a right to benefit is acquired under the legislation of more than one Member State, taking into account only those insurance periods completed under each one of those legislations, the payment of benefits on a provisional basis shall be the responsibility of the institution which first informed the investigating institution of the existence of such a right; it shall be the duty of the investigating institution to inform the other institutions concerned. 4. The institution required to pay benefits under paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 shall forthwith inform the claimant of the fact, drawing his attention explicitly to the provisional nature of the measures taken and to the fact that it is not open to appeal. 5. If no benefit is payable to the claimant on a provisional basis under paragraphs 1, 2 or 3, but it transpires from information received that a right is acquired under Article 46 (2) of the Regulation, the investigating institution shall pay him an appropriate recoverable advance, the amount of which shall be as close as possible to the amount he will probably be awarded under Article 46 (2) of the Regulation. 6. Two Member States or the competent authorities of those Member States may agree to apply other methods of payment of benefits on a provisional basis in cases where only the institutions of those States are concerned. Any such agreements which are concluded on this subject shall be notified to the Administrative Commission. Article 46 Calculation of benefits in the event of overlapping of insurance periods 1. For the calculation of the theoretical and actual amount of benefit in accordance with Article 46 (2) (a) and (b) of the Regulation, the rules provided for in Article 15 (1) (b), (c) and (d) of the Implementing Regulation shall apply. The actual amount thus established shall be increased by the amount corresponding to the periods of voluntary or optional continued insurance, and shall be determined in accordance with the legislation under which these insurance periods were completed. 2. For the purposes of Article 46 (3) of the Regulation, the amounts of benefit corresponding to periods of voluntary or optional continued insurance shall not be taken into account. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply by analogy in the case of the optional complementary insurance referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 15 (3) of the Regulation. For the purposes of German legislation, contributions which are not taken into account under Article 15 (1) (b) of the Implementing Regulation shall be taken into account for the calculation of the additional amounts of the optional complementary insurance. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply by analogy. Article 47 Final calculation of the amount of benefits due from institutions applying Article 46 (3) of the Regulation In the case referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 46 (3) of the Regulation, the investigating institution shall calculate and notify to each of the institutions concerned the final amount of benefits which each institution must grant. Article 48 Notification to the claimant of the decisions of the institutions 1. The final decisions taken by each of the institutions concerned - taking account, where appropriate, of the notification referred to in Article 47 of the Implementing Regulation - shall be forwarded to the investigating institution. Each decision must specify the legal remedies and periods allowed for appeals provided for by the legislation concerned. Upon receipt of all such decisions, the investigating institution shall notify the claimant thereof, in his own language, by means of a summarized statement to which the said decisions shall be attached. Periods allowed for appeals shall run only from the date of receipt of the summarized statement by the claimant. 2. On despatch to the claimant of the summarized statement provided for in paragraph (1), the investigating institution shall simultaneously forward a copy to each one of the institutions concerned, enclosing with it a copy of the decisions of the other institutions. Article 49 Recalculation of benefits 1. The provisions of Articles 45 and 47 of the Implementing Regulation shall apply by analogy for the application of Articles 49 (2) and (3) and 51 (2) of the Regulation. 2. In the event of recalculation, withdrawal or suspension of benefit, the institution which has taken such a decision shall forthwith notify the fact to the person concerned and to each institution with which the said person has established entitlement to benefit, if necessary through the intermediary of the investigating institution. The decision must specify the legal remedies and periods allowed for appeals provided for by the legislation concerned. The periods allowed for appeals shall run only from the date of receipt of the decision by the person concerned. Article 50 Measures designed to accelerate the award of benefits 1. (a) (i) Where a worker who is a national of one Member State becomes subject to the legislation of another Member State, the institution competent in respect of pensions of the latter Member State shall, using all the means at its disposal and at the time of registration of the said worker, forward to the body designated by the competent authority of that same Member State (country of employment), all information relating to the identification of the worker, the date on which he commenced employment, and the name of the said competent institution and the insurance number allotted by the latter. (ii) Moreover, the competent institution referred to in (i) shall also, as far as possible, forward to the body designated under subparagraph (i) any other information which may facilitate and accelerate the ultimate award of the pensions. (iii) Such information shall be forwarded, under conditions fixed by the Administrative Commission, to the body designated by the competent authority of the Member State concerned. (iv) For the implementation of the provisions of subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii), stateless persons and refugees shall be deemed to be nationals of the Member State to whose legislation they were first subject. (b) The institutions concerned shall, at the request of the worker, or of the institution with which he is currently insured, draw up the insurance history of the worker, starting not later than one year before the date on which he will reach pensionable age. 2. The Administrative Commission shall fix the methods for implementing paragraph (1). Administrative checks and medical examinations Article 51 1. When a person in receipt of benefits, in particular: (a) invalidity benefits, (b) old age benefits awarded in the event of unfitness for work, (c) old age benefits awarded to elderly unemployed persons, (d) old age benefits awarded in the event of cessation of a professional or trade activity, (e) survivors' benefits awarded in the event of invalidity or unfitness for work, (f) benefits awarded on condition that the means of the recipient do not exceed a prescribed limit, is staying or residing in the territory of a Member State other than the State in which the institution responsible for payment is situated, administrative checks and medical examinations shall be carried out, at the request of that institution, by the institution of the place of stay or residence of the recipient in accordance with the procedures laid down by the legislation administered by the latter institution. The institution responsible for payment shall, however, retain the right to arrange for the examination of the recipient by a doctor of its own choice. 2. If it is established that the recipient referred to in paragraph (1) is employed or has means in excess of the prescribed limit while receiving benefits, the institution of the place of stay or residence shall send a report to the institution responsible for payment which has requested the check or examination. This report shall indicate in particular the nature of the employment, the amount of earnings or means which the person concerned has had during the last complete quarter, the normal remuneration paid in the same area to a worker at the same level as the person concerned in the occupation which he followed before becoming an invalid over a reference period to be determined by the institution responsible for payment and, where appropriate, the opinion of a medical expert on the state of health of the person concerned. Article 52 When, after suspension of the benefits which he was receiving, the person concerned recovers his right to benefits whilst residing in the territory of a Member State other than the competent State, the institutions concerned shall exchange all information pertinent to the resumption of the provision of the said benefits. Payment of Benefits Article 53 Method of payment of benefits 1. If the institution responsible for payment in a Member State does not pay directly to persons entitled to benefits who are residing in the territory of another Member State the benefits due to them, such benefits shall be paid, at the request of the institution responsible for payment, by the liaison body of the latter Member State or by the institution of the place of residence of the said persons entitled to benefits in accordance with the procedure, provided for in Articles 54 to 58 of the Implementing Regulation; if the institution responsible for payment pays the benefits directly to the persons entitled thereto, it shall notify the institution of the place of residence of this fact. The payment procedure to be applied by the institution of the Member States is specified in Annex 6. 2. Two or more Member States or the competent authorities of those States may agree on other procedures for the payment of benefits in cases where the competent institutions of those Member States are the only ones concerned. Any agreements concluded on this subject shall be notified to the Administrative Commission. 3. The provisions of agreements relating to the payment of benefits which apply on the day preceding the entry into force of the Regulation shall continue to apply provided that they are specified in Annex 5. Article 54 Notification to the paying body of the detailed schedule of payments to be made The institution responsible for payment of benefits shall send to the liaison body of the Member State in whose territory the person entitled to benefits is residing, or to the institution of the place of residence (both hereinafter called 'paying body') a detailed schedule of payments to be made which should reach the paying body not later than twenty days before the date on which those benefits become due. Article 55 Payment of amounts due into the account of the paying body 1. Ten days before the date on which the benefits fall due, the institution responsible for payment shall pay, in the currency of the Member State in whose territory it is situated, the sum necessary for the payments specified in the schedule provided for in Article 54 of the Implementing Regulation. Payment shall be made through the National Bank or through another bank of the Member State in whose territory the institution responsible for payment is situated, into an account opened in the name of the National Bank or of another bank of the Member State in whose territory the paying body is situated, in favour of that body. Such payment shall discharge all liability. The institution responsible for payment shall, at the same time, send notification of payment to the paying body. 2. The bank into whose account payment has been made shall credit the paying body with the exchange value of the payment in the currency of the Member State in whose territory that body is situated. 3. The names and seats of the banks referred to in paragraph 1 are listed in Annex 7. Article 56 Payment of amounts due by the paying body to persons entitled to benefits 1. The payments specified in the schedule provided for in Article 54 of the Implementing Regulation shall be paid to the person entitled to benefits by the paying body on behalf of the institution responsible for payment. Such payments shall be made according to the procedures laid down by the legislation administered by the paying body. 2. As soon as the paying body or any other body designated by it learns of any circumstance justifying the suspension or withdrawal of benefits, it shall discontinue all payment. Such shall also be the case when the person entitled to benefits transfers his residence to the territory of another State. 3. The paying body shall advise the institution responsible for payment of benefits of the reason for any non-payment. In the event of the death of the person entitled to benefits or of his spouse, or in the case of the re-marriage of a widow or widower, the paying body shall notify the said institution of the date thereof. Article 57 Settlement of accounts in respect of the payments referred to in Article 56 of the Implementing Regulation 1. The accounts in respect of the payments referred to in Article 56 of the Implementing Regulation shall be settled at the end of each payment period in order to determine amounts actually paid to persons entitled to benefits or to their legal or authorized representatives as well as amounts unpaid. 2. The total amount, expressed in figures and in words, in the currency of the Member State in whose territory the institution responsible for payment is situated, shall be certified as being in accordance with the payments made by the paying body and endorsed with the signature of that body's representative. 3. The paying body shall guarantee that the payments so determined have been properly made. 4. The difference between the sums paid by the institution responsible for payment, expressed in the currency of the Member State in whose territory that institution is situated, and the value, expressed in the same currency, of the payments accounted for by the paying body shall be entered against the sums to be paid subsequently under the same heading by the institution responsible for payment. Article 58 Expenses incurred in the payment of benefits The expenses incurred in the payment of benefits, particularly postal and bank charges, may be recovered from the recipients by the paying body under the conditions provided for by the legislation administered by that body. Article 59 Notification of transfer of residence of the person entitled to benefits When a person entitled to benefits due under the legislation of one or more Member States transfers his residence from the territory of one State to that of another State, he shall notify this fact to the institution or institutions responsible for the payment of such benefits and to the paying body. CHAPTER 4 ACCIDENTS AT WORK AND OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES Implementation of Articles 52 and 53 of the Regulation Article 60 Benefits in kind in the case of residence in a Member State other than the competent State 1. In order to receive benefits in kind under Article 52 (a) of the Regulation, a worker shall submit to the institution of the place of residence a certified statement testifying that he is entitled to such benefits in kind. This certified statement, based upon information supplied by the employer, where appropriate, shall be issued by the competent institution. Moreover, if the legislation of the competent State so provides, the worker shall submit to the institution of the place of residence a receipt from the competent institution of notification of an accident at work or of an occupational disease. If the worker does not submit such documents, the institution of the place of residence shall obtain them directly from the competent institution and, pending their arrival, it shall grant him the benefits in kind under sickness insurance, provided that he satisfies the conditions for entitlement thereto. 2. That certified statement shall remain valid until the institution of the place of residence receives notification of its cancellation. However, when the said certified statement has been issued by a French institution, it shall only be valid for three months following the date of its issue, and must be renewed every three months. 3. If a worker is a seasonal worker, the certified statement referred to in paragraph 1 shall be valid for the whole of the expected duration of the seasonal work unless, in the meanwhile, the competent institution notifies the institution of the place of residence of its cancellation. 4. When applying for benefits in kind, the worker shall submit the supporting documents required for the granting of benefits in kind under the legislation of the Member State in whose territory he resides. 5. In the event of hospitalization the institution of the place of residence shall, within three days of becoming aware of the fact, notify the competent institution of the date of entry into hospital, the probable duration of hospitalization and the date of leaving hospital. 6. The institution of the place of residence shall notify the competent institution in advance of any decision relating to the granting of the benefits in kind included in the list referred to in Article 24 (2) of the Regulation, enclosing the necessary supporting documents. The competent institution shall have fifteen days from the day on which such information is sent within which to raise any objection and to state the reasons on which such objection is based; if, at the end of that period, no such objection has been raised, the institution of the place of residence shall grant the benefits in kind. Where such benefits in kind have to be granted in a case of extreme urgency, the institution of the place of residence shall forthwith inform the competent institution thereof. 7. The worker shall inform the institution of the place of residence of any change in his situation likely to alter his entitlement to benefits in kind, in particular any cessation of, or change in, employment or any transfer of residence or stay. Likewise, should the worker cease to be insured or cease to be entitled to benefits in kind the competent institution shall inform the institution of the place of residence accordingly. The institution of the place of residence may, at any time, request the competent institution to supply it with any information relating to the worker's insurance or to his entitlement to benefits in kind. 8. In the case of frontier workers, medicinal products, bandages, spectacles and small appliances may be issued, and laboratory analyses and tests carried out, only in the territory of the Member State in which they have been prescribed or recommended in accordance with the legislation of that Member State. 9. Two or more Member States or the competent authorities of those Member States may, having received the Opinion of the Administrative Commission, agree to introduce other implementing provisions. Article 61 Cash benefits other than pensions in the case of residence in a Member State other than the competent State 1. In order to draw cash benefits other than pensions under Article 52 (b) of the Regulation, a worker shall, within three days from the commencement of incapacity for work, apply to the institution of the place of residence by submitting a notification of having ceased work or, if the legislation administered by the competent institution or by the institution of the place of residence so provides, a certificate of incapacity for work issued by the doctor treating the worker concerned. 2. If the doctors treating the worker concerned in the country of residence do not issue certificates of incapacity for work, the worker shall apply directly to the institution of the place of residence within the time-limit fixed by the legislation which it administers. That institution shall immediately have the incapacity for work medically confirmed and the certificate referred to in paragraph 1 drawn up. Such certificate shall state the probable duration of the incapacity, and shall be forwarded to the competent institution forthwith. 3. In cases where paragraph 2 does not apply, the institution of the place of residence shall, as soon as possible and in any event within the three days following the date on which the worker applied to it, have the worker medically examined as if he were insured with that institution. The report of the examining doctor shall indicate, in particular, the probable duration of the incapacity for work, and shall be forwarded to the competent institution by the institution of the place of residence within the three days following the date of the examination. 4. The institution of the place of residence shall subsequently carry out any necessary administrative checks or medical examinations of the worker as if he were insured with that institution. As soon as it establishes that the worker is fit to resume work it shall forthwith notify the worker and the competent institution thereof, stating the date on which the worker's incapacity ceased. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 6, the notification to the worker shall be treated as a decision taken on behalf of the competent institution. 5. In all cases, the competent institution shall reserve the right to have the worker examined by a doctor of its own choice. 6. If the competent institution decides to withhold the cash benefits because the worker has not completed the formalities laid down by the legislation of the country of residence, or if it establishes that the worker is fit to resume work, it shall notify the worker of its decision and shall simultaneously send a copy of such decision to the institution of the place of residence. 7. When the worker resumes work, he shall notify the competent institution accordingly if such notification is required by the legislation administered by that institution. 8. The competent institution shall pay cash benefits by the appropriate method, in particular by international money order, and shall inform the institution of the place of residence and the worker accordingly. Where cash benefits are paid by the institution of the place of residence on behalf of the competent institution, the latter shall inform the worker of his rights and shall notify the institution of the place of residence of the amount of the cash benefits, the dates for payment and the maximum period during which they should be granted, in accordance with the legislation of the competent State. 9. Two or more Member States or the competent authorities thereof may, having received the Opinion of the Administrative Commission, agree to introduce other implementing provisions. Implementation of Article 55 of the Regulation Article 62 Benefits in kind in the case of a stay in a Member State other than the competent State 1. In order to receive benefits in kind, a worker covered by Article 14 (1) (a) (i), or (2) (a) of the Regulation shall submit to the institution of the place of stay the certificate provided for in Article 11 of the Implementing Regulation. A worker who has submitted such certificate shall be presumed to have satisfied the conditions for acquisition of the right to benefits in kind. 2. In order to receive benefits in kind, a worker employed in international transport as mentioned in Article 14 (1) (b) of the Regulation who, in the course of his employment, goes to the territory of a Member State other than the competent State shall, as soon as possible, submit to the institution of the place of stay a special certified statement issued during the current calendar month or during the two preceding calendar months by the employer or his agent. Such certified statement shall state, in particular, the date from which the worker has been employed by the said employer and the name and address of the competent institution. A worker who has submitted such certified statement shall be presumed to have satisfied the conditions for acquisition of the right to benefits in kind. If a worker is unable to contact the institution of the place of stay before receiving medical treatment he shall, nevertheless, receive such treatment on presentation of the said certified statement as if he were insured with that institution. 3. The institution of the place of stay shall within three days inquire of the competent institution whether a worker covered by paragraph 1 or 2 satisfies the conditions for acquisition of the right to benefits in kind. The institution of the place of stay shall provide the benefits in kind until it receives a reply from the competent institution, but for not more than thirty days. 4. The competent institution shall send its reply to the institution of the place of stay within ten days of the receipt of the request from that institution. If that reply is in the affirmative the competent institution shall indicate, if necessary, the maximum period during which benefits in kind may be granted, in accordance with the legislation which it administers, and the institution of the place of stay shall continue to provide the said benefits. 5. Benefits in kind provided by virtue of the presumption made in paragraph 1 or 2 shall be reimbursed as provided for in Article 36 (1) of the Regulation. 6. In place of the certificate or certified statement provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 respectively, workers covered these paragraphs may submit to the institution of the place of stay a certified statement as provided for in paragraph 7. 7. In order to receive benefits in kind under Article 55 (1) (a) (i) of the Regulation, except in cases where a presumption is made under paragraphs 1 and 2, a worker shall submit to the institution of the place of stay a certified statement testifying that he is entitled to benefits in kind. Such certified statement, which shall be issued by the competent institution, if possible before the worker leaves the territory of the Member State in which he resides, shall specify in particular, where necessary, the maximum period during which benefits in kind may be granted, in accordance with the legislation of the competent State. If the worker does not submit the said certified statement, the institution of the place of stay shall obtain it from the competent institution. 8. Article 60 (5) (6) and (9) of the Implementing Regulation shall apply by analogy. Article 63 Benefits in kind for workers who transfer their residence or return to their country of residence, and for workers authorized to go to another Member State for medical treatment 1. In order to receive benefits in kind under Article 55 (1) (b) (i) of the Regulation, a worker shall submit to the institution of the place of residence a certified statement testifying that he is entitled to continue receiving the said benefits. This certified statement, which shall be issued by the competent institution, shall specify in particular, where necessary, the maximum period during which such benefits may continue to be provided, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation of the competent State. The certified statement may, at the worker's request, be issued after his departure if, for reasons of force majeure, it cannot be drawn up beforehand. 2. Article 60 (5), (6) and (9) of the Implementing Regulation shall apply by analogy. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply by analogy in respect of the provision of benefits in kind in the case referred to in Article 55 (1) (c) (i) of the Regulation. Article 64 Cash benefits other than pensions in the case of a stay in a Member State other than the competent State Article 61 of the Implementing Regulation shall apply by analogy in respect of the drawing of cash benefits, other than pensions, under Article 55 (1) (a) (ii) of the Regulation.

When a final decision has been reached on this subject, the competent institution shall forthwith notify the fact to the institution of the place of residence or to the institution of the place of stay which provided the benefits in kind. Where the case is not one of an accident at work or an occupational disease that institution shall continue to provide the said benefits in kind under sickness insurance if the worker is entitled thereto.

The amount of benefits in kind provided under Article 19 (2) of the Regulation to the members of the family of a worker who are not residing in the territory of the same Member State as such worker shall be refunded by the competent institutions to the institutions which provided the said benefits on the basis of a lump-sum in respect of each calendar year which is as close as possible to the actual expenditure incurred. 2. The lump-sum payment shall be determined by multiplying the average annual cost per family by the average number of families to be taken into account each year, and by reducing the resultant amount by twenty per cent. 3. The factors necessary for the calculation of the said lump-sum shall be determined as follows: (a) the average annual cost per family shall be obtained, for each Member State, by dividing the annual expenditure on all the benefits in kind provided by the institutions of that Member State to all the members of the families of workers who are subject to the legislation of the said Member State, under the social security schemes to be taken into consideration, by the average annual number of such workers with family members; the social security schemes to be taken into consideration for that purpose are specified in Annex 9; (b) in dealings between the institutions of two Member States, the average annual number of families to be taken into account shall be equal to the average annual number of workers who are subject to the legislation of one of those Member States and the members of whose families are entitled to benefits in kind to be provided by an institution of the other Member State. 4. The number of families to be taken into account in accordance with paragraph 3 (b) shall be determined by means of a list kept for that purpose by the institution of the place of residence, based upon documentary evidence supplied by the competent institution of the rights of the persons concerned.

The factors necessary for the calculation of the said lump-sum shall be determined according to the following rules: (a) the average annual cost per pensioner shall be obtained, for each Member State, by dividing the annual costs of the total benefits in kind provided by the institutions of that Member State to all pensioners whose pensions are payable under the legislation of that Member State, under the social security schemes to be taken into consideration and to members of their families, by the average annual number of pensioners; the social security schemes to be taken into consideration for that purpose are specified in Annex 9; (b) in dealings between the institutions of two Member States, the average annual number of pensioners to be taken into account shall be equal to the average annual number of pensioners referred to in Article 28 (2) of the Regulation who, whilst residing in the territory of one of the Member States, are entitled to benefits in kind chargeable to the institution of the other Member State. 4. The number of pensioners to be taken into account in accordance with paragraph 3 (b) shall be determined by means of a list kept for that purpose by the institution of the place of residence, based upon documentary evidence supplied by the competent institution of the rights of the persons concerned. In the event of any dispute, the observations of the institutions involved shall be submitted to the Audit Board provided for in Article 101 (3) of the Implementing Regulation. 5. The Administrative Commission shall lay down the methods and procedures for determining the calculation factors referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4. 6.

If, under that legislation, the amount of the benefit does not depend on the length of the insurance periods, then that amount shall be taken as the theoretical amount referred to in this subparagraph;(b) the institution shall then establish the actual amount of the benefit on the basis of the theoretical amount referred to in the preceding subparagraph and in the ratio which the length of the insurance periods completed before the materialisation of the risk under the legislation administered by that institution, bears to the total length of the insurance periods completed before materialisation of the risk under the legislations of all the Member States concerned;(c) if the total length of the insurance periods completed under the legislations of all the Member States concerned before the materialisation of the risk is longer than the maximum period required by the legislation of one of these States for receipt of full benefit, the competent institution of that State shall, when applying the provisions of this paragraph, take into consideration this maximum period instead of the total length of the periods completed; this method of calculation must not result in the imposition on that institution of the costs of a benefit greater than the full benefit provided for by the legislation which it administers;(d) the procedure for taking into account duplicate periods when applying the rules of calculation laid down in this paragraph, shall be laid down in the implementing Regulation referred to in Article 97.3.

Before that date the Council shall, by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, decide on the adjustments to be made thereto. Article 9 1. While any measure referred to in Articles 6 to 8 is in operation, consultations within the Committee shall be held, either at the request of a Member State or on the initiative of the Commission. The purpose of such consultations shall be: (a) to examine the effects of the measures; (b) to ascertain whether the conditions for its application are still satisfied. 2. Where the Commission considers that any measure provided for in Article 6 or in Article 7 should be revoked or amended, it shall proceed as follows: (a) where the Council has taken no decision on a measure taken by the Commission, the latter shall amend or revoke such measure forthwith and shall immediately deliver a report to the Council; (b) in all other cases, the Commission shall propose to the Council that the measures adopted by the Council be revoked or amended. The Council shall act by a qualified majority. TITLE IV Transitional and final provisions Article 10 Until such time as the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall have introduced common rules in respect of the products listed in the Annex to this Regulation, the principle of freedom of export from the Community as laid down in Article 1 shall not apply to those products. Article 11 Without prejudice to other Community provisions, this Regulation shall not preclude the adoption or application by a Member State of quantitative restrictions on exports on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security ; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants ; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value, or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Article 12 1. This Regulation shall be without prejudice to the operation of the instruments establishing common organisation of agricultural markets, or of the special instruments adopted under Article 235 of the Treaty for processed agricultural products ; it shall operate by way of complement to those instruments. 2. However, in the case of products covered by such instruments, the provisions of Articles 6 and 8 shall not apply to those in respect of which the Community rules on trade with third countries make provision for the application of quantitative export restrictions. The provisions of Article 5 shall not apply to those products in respect of which such rules require the production of a licence or other export document. Article 13 This Regulation shall enter into force on 31 December 1969. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

"115","31969R1191","SECTION I General provisions Article 1 1. Member States shall terminate all obligations inherent in the concept of a public service as defined in this Regulation imposed on transport by rail, road and inland waterway. 2. Nevertheless, such obligations may be maintained in so far as they are essential in order to ensure the provision of adequate transport services. 3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply, as regards passenger transport, to transport rates and conditions imposed by any Member State in the interests of one or more particular categories of person. 4. Financial burdens devolving on transport undertakings by reason of the maintenance of the obligations referred to in paragraph 2, or of the application of the transport rates and conditions referred to in paragraph 3, shall be subject to compensation made in accordance with common procedures laid down in this Regulation. Article 2 1. ""Public service obligations"" means obligations which the transport undertaking in question, if it were considering its own commercial interests, would not assume or would not assume to the same extent or under the same conditions. 2. Public service obligations within the meaning of paragraph 1 consist of the obligation to operate, the obligation to carry and tariff obligations. 3. For the purposes of this Regulation ""the obligation to carry"" means any obligation imposed upon a transport undertaking to take, in respect of any route or installations which it is authorised to work by licence or equivalent authorisation, all necessary measures to ensure the provision of a transport service satisfying fixed standards of continuity, regularity and capacity. It also includes any obligation to operate additional services and any obligation to maintain in good condition routes, equipment - in so far as this is surplus to the requirements of the network as a whole - and installations after services have been withdrawn. 4. For the purposes of this Regulation, ""the obligation to carry"" means any obligation imposed upon transport undertakings to accept and carry passengers or goods at specified rates and subject to specified conditions. 5. For the purposes of this Regulation, ""tariff obligations"" means any obligation imposed upon transport undertakings to apply, in particular for certain categories of passenger, for certain categories of goods, or on certain routes, rates fixed or approved by any public authority which are contrary to the commercial interests of the undertaking and which result from the imposition of, or refusal to modify, special tariff provisions. The provisions of the foregoing subparagraph shall not apply to obligations arising from general measures of price policy applying to the economy as a whole or to measures taken with respect to transport rates and conditions in general with a view to the organisation of the transport market or of part thereof. SECTION II Common principles for the termination or maintenance of public service obligations Article 3 1. Where the competent authorities of the Member States decide to maintain, in whole or in part, a public service obligation, and where this can be done in more than one way, each capable of ensuring, while satisfying similar conditions, the provision of adequate transport services, the competent authorities shall select the way least costly to the Community. 2. The adequacy of transport services shall be assessed having regard to: (a) the public interest; (b) the possibility of having recourse to other forms of transport and the ability of such forms to meet the transport needs under consideration; (c) the transport rates and conditions which can be quoted to users. Article 4 1. It shall be for transport undertakings to apply to the competent authorities of the Member States for the termination in whole or in part of any public service obligation where such obligation entails economic disadvantages for them. 2. In their applications, transport undertakings may propose the substitution of some other form for the forms of transport being used. Undertakings shall apply the provisions of Article 5 to calculate what savings could be made as a means of improving their financial position. Article 5 1. Any obligation to operate or to carry shall be regarded as imposing economic disadvantages where the reduction in the financial burden which would be possible as a result of the total or partial termination of the obligation in respect of an operation or a group of operations affected by that obligation exceeds the reduction in revenue resulting from that termination. Economic disadvantages shall be determined on the basis of a statement, actualised if necessary, of the annual economic disadvantages represented by the difference between the reductions in the annual financial burden and in annual revenue that would result from termination of the obligation. However, where the obligation to operate or to carry covers one or more categories of the passenger or goods traffic on the whole or a substantial part of a network, the financial burden which would be eliminated by terminating the obligation shall be estimated by allocating among the various categories of traffic the total costs borne by the undertaking by reason of its transport activities. The economic disadvantage will in such case be equal to the difference between the costs allocable to that part of the undertaking's activities affected by the public service obligation and the corresponding revenue. Economic disadvantages shall be determined taking into account the effects of the obligation on the undertaking's activities as a whole. 2. A tariff obligation shall be regarded as entailing economic disadvantages where the difference between the revenue from the traffic to which the obligation applies and the financial burden of such traffic is less than the difference between the revenue which would be produced by that traffic and the financial burden thereof if working were on a commercial basis-account being taken both of the costs of those operations which are subject to the obligation and of the state of the market. Article 6 1. Within one year of the date of the entry into force of this Regulation transport undertakings shall lodge with the competent authorities of the Member States the applications referred to in Article 4. Transport undertakings may lodge applications after the expiry of the aforementioned period if they find that the provisions of Article 4 (1) are satisfied. 2. Decisions to maintain a public service obligation or part thereof, or to terminate it at the end of a specified period, shall provide for compensation to be granted in respect of the financial burdens resulting therefrom ; the amount of such compensation shall be determined in accordance with the common procedures laid down in Articles 10 to 13. 3. The competent authorities of the Member States shall take decisions within one year of the date on which the application is lodged as regards obligations to operate or to carry, and within six months as regards tariff obligations. The right to compensation shall arise on the date of the decision by the competent autorities but in any event not before 1 January 1971. 4. However, if the competent authorities of the Member States consider it necessary by reason of the number and importance of the applications lodged by each undertaking, they may extend the period prescribed in the first subparagraph of paragraph 3 until 1 January 1972 at the latest. In such case, the right to compensation shall arise on that date. Where they intend to avail themselves of this power, the competent authorities of the Member States shall so inform the undertakings concerned within six months following the lodging of applications. Should any Member State meet with special difficulties, the Council may, at the request of that State and on a proposal from the Commission, authorise the State concerned to extend until 1 January 1973 the time limit indicated in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. 5. If the competent authorities have not reached a decision within the time limit laid down, the obligation in respect of which the application under Article 4 (1) for termination was made shall stand terminated. 6. The Council shall, on the basis of a report submitted by the Commission before 31 December 1972, study the situation in each Member State with regard to the implementation of this Regulation. Article 7 1. There may be attached to any decision to maintain an obligation conditions designed to improve the yield of the operations affected by the obligation in question. 2. Any decision to terminate an obligation may provide for the introduction of an alternative service. In such a case termination shall not take effect until such time as the alternative service has been put into operation. Article 8 1. The Member State concerned shall communicate to the Commission, before implementation, any measure terminating the obligation to operate or to carry which it proposes to take in respect of any route or transport service liable to affect trade or traffic between Member States. It shall inform the other Member States thereof. 2. If the Commission considers it necessary or if another Member State so requests, the Commission shall consult with the Member States concerning the proposed measure. 3. The Commission shall, within two months following receipt of the communication referred to in paragraph 1, address an opinion or a recommendation to all Member States concerned. SECTION III Application to passenger transport of transport rates and conditions imposed in the interests of one or more particular categories of person Article 9 1. The amount of compensation in respect of financial burdens devolving upon undertakings by reason of the application to passenger transport of transport rates and conditions imposed in the interests of one or more particular categories of person shall be determined in accordance with the common procedures laid down in Articles 11 to 13. 2. Compensation shall be payable from 1 January 1971. Should any Member State meet with special difficulties, the Council may, at the request of that State and on a proposal from the Commission, authorise the State concerned to alter that date to 1 January 1972. 3. Applications for compensation shall be lodged with the competent authorities of the Member States. SECTION IV Common compensation procedures Article 10 1. The amount of the compensation provided for in Article 6 shall, in the case of an obligation to operate or to carry, be equal to the difference between the reduction in financial burden and the reduction in revenue of the undertaking if the whole or the relevant part of the obligation in question were terminated for the period of time under consideration. However, where the calculation of economic disadvantage was made by allocating among the various parts of its transport activities the total costs borne by the undertaking in respect of those transport activities, the amount of the compensation shall be equal to the difference between the costs allocable to that part of the undertaking's activities affected by the public service obligation and the corresponding revenue. 2. For the purposes of determining the financial burdens and revenue referred to in paragraph 1, the effects of the termination of the obligation in question on the undertaking's activities as a whole shall be taken into account. Article 11 1. The amount of the compensation provided for in Article 6 and in Article 9 (1) shall, in the case of a tariff obligation, be equal to the difference between the two amounts as follows: (a) The first amount shall be equal to the difference between, on the one hand, the product of the anticipated number of units of measure of transport and: - either the most favourable existing rate which might be claimed by users if the obligation in question did not exist ; or, - where there is no such rate, the rate which the undertaking, operating on a commercial basis and taking into account both the costs of the operation in question and the state of the market, would have applied; and, on the other hand, the product of the actual number of units of measure of transport and the rate imposed for the period under consideration. (b) The second amount shall be equal to the difference between the costs which would be incurred applying either the most favourable existing rate or the rate which the undertaking would have applied if operating on a commercial basis and the costs actually incurred under the obligatory rate. 2. Where, by reason of the state of the market, compensation calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 is not sufficient to cover the total costs of the traffic affected by the tariff obligation in question, the amount of the compensation provided for in Article 9 (1) shall be equal to the difference between such costs and the revenue from such traffic. Any compensation already made under Article 10 shall be taken into consideration when making this calculation. 3. In making the calculation of revenue and costs as provided in paragraph 1, the effects which termination of the obligation in question would have on the undertaking's activities as a whole shall be taken into account. Article 12 Costs resulting from the maintenance of obligations shall be calculated on the basis of efficient management of the undertaking and the provision of transport services of an adequate quality. Interest relating to own capital may be deducted from the interest taken into account in the calculation of costs. Article 13 1. Decisions taken under Articles 6 and 9 shall fix in advance the amount of compensation for a period of at least one year. At the same time they shall determine the factors which might warrant an adjustment of that amount. 2. Adjustment of the amount referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made each year, after closure of the annual accounts of the undertaking in question. 3. Payment of compensation fixed in advance shall be made by instalments. The payment of any sums due by reason of the adjustment provided for in paragraph 2 shall be made immediately after the amount of the adjustment has been determined. SECTION V Imposition of new public service obligations Article 14 1. Save for cases falling within Article 1 (3), after the date of entry into force of this Regulation Member States may impose public service obligations on a transport undertaking only in so far as such obligations are essential in order to ensure the provision of adequate transport services. 2. Where obligations thus imposed entail for transport undertakings economic disadvantages within the meaning of Article 5 (1) and (2) or financial burdens within the meaning of Article 9, the competent authorities of the Member States shall, when deciding to impose such obligations, provide for grants of compensation in respect of the financial burdens resulting therefrom. The provisions of Articles 10 to 13 shall apply. SECTION VI Final provisions Article 15 Decisions made by the competent authorities of Member States in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, shall state the reasons on which they are based and shall be published in the appropriate manner. Article 16 Member States shall ensure that transport undertakings, in their capacity as transport undertakings, are given the opportunity to make representations concerning their interests, by appropriate means, with regard to decisions taken pursuant to this Regulation. Article 17 1. The Commission may request Member States to supply all relevant information concerning the operation of this Regulation. Whenever it considers it necessary, the Commission shall consult with the Member States concerned. 2. Compensation paid pursuant to this Regulation shall be exempt from the preliminary information procedure laid down in Article 93 (3) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. Member States shall promptly forward to the Commission details, classified by category of obligation, of compensation payments made in respect of financial burdens devolving upon transport undertakings by reason of the maintenance of the public service obligations set out in Article 2 or by reason of the application to passenger transport of transport rates and conditions imposed in the interests of one or more particular categories of person. Article 18 1. Member States shall, after consulting the Commission and in good time, adopt such laws, regulations or administrative provisions as may be necessary for the implementation of this Regulation and in particular of Article 4 thereof. 2. Where a Member State so requests, or where the Commission considers it appropriate, the Commission shall consult with the Member States concerned upon the proposed terms of the measures referred to in paragraph 1. Article 19 1. As regards railway undertakings, this Regulation shall, in respect of their rail transport operations, apply to the following undertakings: - SociÃ ©tÃ © nationale des chemins de fer belges (SNCB)/Nationale Maatschappij der Belgische Spoorwegen (NMBS); - Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB); - SociÃ ©tÃ © nationale des chemins de fer franÃ §ais (SNCF); - Azienda autonoma delle Ferrovie dello Stato (FS); - SociÃ ©tÃ © nationale des chemins de fer luxembourgeois (CFL); - Naamloze Vennootschap Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS); 2. As regards other transport undertakings, this Regulation shall not apply to undertakings mainly providing transport services of a local or regional character. 3. Within three years of the entry into force of this Regulation the Council shall, on the basis of the principles and objectives set out in Section II of its Decision of 13 May 1965, decide on the action to be taken with regard to obligations inherent in the concept of a public service affecting transport operations which are not covered by this Regulation. Article 20 This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 1969. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. Done at Luxembourg, 26 June 1969.

"116","31968R1612","TITLE I Eligibility for employment Article 1 1. Any national of a Member State, shall, irrespective of his place of residence, have the right to take up an activity as an employed person, and to pursue such activity, within the territory of another Member State in accordance with the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action governing the employment of nationals of that State. 2. He shall, in particular, have the right to take up available employment in the territory of another Member State with the same priority as nationals of that State. Article 2 Any national of a Member State and any employer pursuing an activity in the territory of a Member State may exchange their applications for and offers of employment, and may conclude and perform contracts of employment in accordance with the provisions in force laid down by law, regulation or administrative action, without any discrimination resulting therefrom. Article 3 1. Under this Regulation, provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action or administrative practices of a Member State shall not apply: - where they limit application for and offers of employment, or the right of foreign nationals to take up and pursue employment or subject these to conditions not applicable in respect of their own nationals ; or - where, though applicable irrespective of nationality, their exclusive or principal aim or effect is to keep nationals of other Member States away from the employment offered. This provision shall not apply to conditions relating to linguistic knowledge required by reason of the nature of the post to be filled. 2. There shall be included in particular among the provisions or practices of a Member State referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 those which: (a) prescribe a special recruitment procedure for foreign nationals; (b) limit or restrict the advertising of vacancies in the press or through any other medium or subject it to conditions other than those applicable in respect of employers pursuing their activities in the territory of that Member State; (c) subject eligibility for employment to conditions of registration with employment offices or impede recruitment of individual workers, where persons who do not reside in the territory of that State are concerned. Article 4 1. Provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action of the Member States which restrict by number or percentage the employment of foreign nationals in any undertaking, branch of activity or region, or at a national level, shall not apply to nationals of the other Member States. 2. When in a Member State the granting of any benefit to undertakings is subject to a minimum percentage of national workers being employed, nationals of the other Member States shall be counted as national workers, subject to the provisions of the Council Directive of 15 October 1963.2 1 OJ No L 257, 19.10.1968, p. 1. 2 OJ No 159, 2.11.1963, p. 2661/63. Article 5 A national of a Member State who seeks employment in the territory of another Member State shall receive the same assistance there as that afforded by the employment offices in that State to their own nationals seeking employment. Article 6 1. The engagement and recruitment of a national of one Member State for a post in another Member State shall not depend on medical, vocational or other criteria which are discriminatory on grounds of nationality by comparison with those applied to nationals of the other Member State who wish to pursue the same activity. 2. Nevertheless, a national who holds an offer in his name from an employer in a Member State other than that of which he is a national may have to undergo a vocational test, if the employer expressly requests this when making his offer of employment. TITLE II Employment and equality of treatment Article 7 1. A worker who is a national of a Member State may not, in the territory of another Member State, be treated differently from national workers by reason of his nationality in respect of any conditions of employment and work, in particular as regards remuneration, dismissal, and should he become unemployed, reinstatement or re-employment; 2. He shall enjoy the same social and tax advantages as national workers. 3. He shall also, by virtue of the same right and under the same conditions as national workers, have access to training in vocational schools and retraining centres. 4. Any clause of a collective or individual agreement or of any other collective regulation concerning eligibility for employment, employment, remuneration and other conditions of work or dismissal shall be null and void in so far as it lays down or authorises discriminatory conditions in respect of workers who are nationals of the other Member States. Article 8 1. A worker who is a national of a Member State and who is employed in the territory of another Member State shall enjoy equality of treatment as regards membership of trade unions and the exercise of rights attaching thereto, including the right to vote ; he may be excluded from taking part in the management of bodies governed by public law and from holding an office governed by public law. Furthermore, he shall have the right of eligibility for workers' representative bodies in the undertaking. The provisions of this Article shall not affect laws or regulations in certain Member States which grant more extensive rights to workers coming from the other Member States. 2. This Article shall be reviewed by the Council on the basis of a proposal from the Commission which shall be submitted within not more than two years. Article 9 1. A worker who is a national of a Member State and who is employed in the territory of another Member State shall enjoy all the rights and benefits accorded to national workers in matters of housing, including ownership of the housing he needs. 2. Such worker may, with the same right as nationals, put his name down on the housing lists in the region in which he is employed, where such lists exist ; he shall enjoy the resultant benefits and priorities. If his family has remained in the country whence he came, they shall be considered for this purpose as residing in the said region, where national workers benefit from a similar presumption. TITLE III Workers' families Article 10 1. The following shall, irrespective of their nationality, have the right to install themselves with a worker who is a national of one Member State and who is employed in the territory of another Member State: (a) his spouse and their descendants who are under the age of 21 years or are dependants; (b) dependent relatives in the ascending line of the worker and his spouse. 2. Member States shall facilitate the admission of any member of the family not coming within the provisions of paragraph 1 if dependent on the worker referred to above or living under his roof in the country whence he comes. 3. For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, the worker must have available for his family housing considered as normal for national workers in the region where he is employed ; this provision, however must not give rise to discrimination between national workers and workers from the other Member States. Article 11 Where a national of a Member State is pursuing an activity as an employed or self-employed person in the territory of another Member State, his spouse and those of the children who are under the age of 21 years or dependent on him shall have the right to take up any activity as an employed person throughout the territory of that same State, even if they are not nationals of any Member State. Article 12 The children of a national of a Member State who is or has been employed in the territory of another Member State shall be admitted to that State's general educational, apprenticeship and vocational training courses under the same conditions as the nationals of that State, if such children are residing in its territory. Member States shall encourage all efforts to enable such children to attend these courses under the best possible conditions. PART II CLEARANCE OF VACANCIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT TITLE I Co-operation between the Member States and with the Commission Article 13 1. The Member States or the Commission shall instigate or together undertake any study of employment or unemployment which they consider necessary for securing freedom of movement for workers within the Community. The central employment services of the Member States shall co-operate closely with each other and with the Commission with a view to acting jointly as regards the clearing of vacancies and applications for employment within the Community and the resultant placing of workers in employment. 2. To this end the Member States shall designate specialist services which shall be entrusted with organising work in the fields referred to above and co-operating with each other and with the departments of the Commission. The Member States shall notify the Commission of any change in the designation of such services ; the Commission shall publish details thereof for information in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Article 14 1. The Member States shall send to the Commission information on problems arising in connection with the freedom of movement and employment of workers and particulars of the state and development of employment by region and by branch of activity. 2. In co-operation with the Technical Committee, the Commission shall determine the manner in which the information referred to in paragraph 1 shall be drawn up and the intervals at which it shall be communicated. To assess the state of their labour markets, the Member States shall use uniform criteria established by the Commission in accordance with the results of the work of the Technical Committee carried out in pursuance of Article 33 (d), after having obtained the Opinion of the Advisory Committee. 3. In accordance with the procedure laid down by the Commission in agreement with the Technical Committee, the specialist service of each Member State shall send to the specialist services of the other Member States and to the European Co-ordination Office such information concerning living and working conditions and the state of the labour market as is likely to be of guidance to workers from the other Member States. Such information shall be brought up to date regularly. The specialist services of the other Member States shall ensure that wide publicity is given to such information, in particular by circulating it among the appropriate employment services and by all suitable means of communication for informing the workers concerned. TITLE II Machinery for vacancy clearance Article 15 1. At least once a month the specialist service of each Member State shall send to the specialist services of the other Member States and to the European Co-ordination Office a return showing by occupation and by region: (a) vacancies unfilled or unlikely to be filled by manpower from the national labour market; (b) applicants for employment who have declared themselves actually ready and able to accept employment in another country. The specialist service of each Member State shall forward such information to the appropriate employment services and agencies. 2. The returns referred to in paragraph 1 shall be circulated according to a uniform system to be established by the European Co-ordination Office in collaboration with the Technical Committee, within eighteen months following the entry into force of this Regulation. Article 16 1. Any vacancy communicated to the employment services of a Member State which cannot be filled from the national labour market and which, on the basis of the returns referred to in Article 15, can be cleared within the Community, shall be notified to the competent employment services of the Member State which has indicated that it has manpower available in the same occupation. 2. Such services shall forward to the services of the first Member State the details of suitable applications. For a period of 18 days from receipt of the communication of the vacancy to the services of the second Member State, such applications shall be submitted to employers with the same priority as that granted to national workers over nationals of non-Member States. During the above-mentioned period, vacancies shall be notified to non-Member States only if the Member State having such vacancies considers that for the occupations corresponding to such vacancies there are insufficient workers available who are nationals of the Member States. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to vacancies offered to workers who are nationals of non-Member States where: (a) such an offer is made to a named worker and is of a special nature in view of: (i) the requirement of specialist qualifications or the confidential nature of the post offered or previous occupational ties; (ii) the existence of family ties either between the employer and the worker asked for, or between the latter and a worker who has been employed regularly for at least a year in the undertaking. Items (i) and (ii) shall be applied in accordance with the provisions set out in the Annex; (b) such vacancies are for the recruitment of homogeneous groups of seasonal workers of whom at least one named member has been offered a vacancy; (c) such vacancies are offered by employers to workers resident in regions adjacent to either side of the frontier between a Member State and a non-Member State; (d) vacancies are offered expressly to workers from non-Member States by the employer for reasons connected with the smooth running of the undertaking, where the employment services, having intervened for the purposes of securing the employment of national workers or workers from the other Member States of the Community, are of the opinion that such reasons are justified. Article 17 1. The provisions of Article 16 shall be implemented by the specialist services. However, in so far as they have been authorised by the central services and in so far as the organisation of the employment services of a Member State and the placing techniques employed make it possible: (a) the regional employment services of the Member States shall: (i) on the basis of the returns referred to in Article 15, on which appropriate action will be taken, directly bring together and clear vacancies and applications for employment; (ii) establish direct relations for clearance: - of vacancies offered to a named worker; - of individual applications for employment sent either to a specific employment service or to an employer pursuing his activity within the area covered by such a service; - where the clearing operations concern seasonal workers who must be recruited as quickly as possible; (b) the services territorially responsible for the border regions of two or more Member States shall regularly exchange data relating to vacancies and applications for employment outstanding in their area and, acting in accordance with their arrangements with the other employment services of their countries, shall directly bring together and clear vacancies and applications for employment; (c) official employment services which specialise in certain occupations or specific categories of persons shall cooperate directly with each other. 2. The Member States concerned shall forward to the Commission the list, drawn up by common accord, of services referred to in paragraph 1 ; the Commission shall publish such list, and any amendment thereto, in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Article 18 Adoption of recruiting procedures as applied by the implementing bodies provided for under agreements concluded between two or more Member States shall not be obligatory. TITLE III Measures for controlling the balance of the labour market Article 19 1. Twice a year, on the basis of a report from the Commission drawn up from information supplied by the Member States, the latter and the Commission shall together analyse: - the results of Community arrangements for vacancy clearance; - the number of placings of nationals of non-Member States; - the foreseeable developments in the state of the labour market and, as far as possible, the movements of manpower within the Community. 2. The Member States shall examine with the Commission all the possibilities of giving priority to nationals of Member States when filling employment vacancies in order to achieve a balance between vacancies and applications for employment within the Community. They shall adopt all measures necessary for this purpose. Article 20 1. When a Member State undergoes or foresees disturbances on its labour market which could seriously threaten the standard of living or level of employment in a given region or occupation, that State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof and shall supply them with all relevant particulars. 2. The Member States and the Commission shall take all suitable measures to inform Community workers so that they shall not apply for employment in that region or occupation. 3. Without prejudice to the application of the Treaty and of the Protocols annexed thereto, the Member State referred to in paragraph 1 may request the Commission to state that, in order to restore to normal the situation in that region or occupation, the operation of the clearance machinery provided for in Articles 15, 16 and 17 should be partially or totally suspended. The Commission shall decide on the suspension as such and on the duration thereof not later than two weeks after receiving such request. Any Member State may, within a strict time limit of two weeks, request the Council to annul or amend any such decision. The Council shall act on any such request within two weeks. 4. Where such suspension does take place, the employment services of the other Member States which have indicated that they have workers available shall not take any action to fill vacancies notified directly to them by employers in the Member States referred to in paragraph 1. TITLE IV European Co-ordination Office Article 21 The European Office for Co-ordinating the Clearance of Vacancies and Applications for Employment, established within the Commission (called in this Regulation the ""European Co-ordination Office""), shall have the general task of promoting vacancy clearance at Community level. It shall be responsible in particular for all the technical duties in this field which, under the provisions of this Regulation, are assigned to the Commission, and especially for assisting the national employment services.

These provisions shall apply also to operations of providers of services ancillary to transport which have any of the objects or effects listed above. Article 2 Prohibition of restrictive practices Subject to the provisions of Article 3 to 6, the following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market, no prior decision to that effect being required : all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices liable to affect trade between Member States which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of completion within the common market, and in particular those which: (a) directly or indirectly fix transport rates and conditions or any other trading conditions; (b) limit or control the supply of transport, markets, technical development or investment; (c) share transport markets; (d) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; (e) make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of additional obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the provision of transport services. Article 3 Exception for technical agreements 1. The prohibition laid down in Article 2 shall not apply to agreements, decisions or concerted practices the object and effect of which is to apply technical improvements or to achieve technical co-operation by means of: (a) the standardisation of equipment, transport supplies, vehicles or fixed installations; (b) the exchange or pooling, for the purpose of operating transport services, of staff, equipment, vehicles or fixed installations; (c) the organisation and execution of successive, complementary, substitute or combined transport operations, and the fixing and application of inclusive rates and conditions for such operations, including special competitive rates; (d) the use, for journeys by a single mode of transport, of the routes which are most rational from the operational point of view; (e) the co-ordination of transport timetables for connecting routes; (f) the grouping of single consignments; (g) the establishment of uniform rules as to the structure of tariffs and their conditions of application, provided such rules do not lay down transport rates and conditions. 2. The Commission shall, where appropriate, submit proposals to the Council with a view to extending or reducing the list in paragraph 1. Article 4 Exemption for groups of small and medium-sized undertakings 1. The agreements, decisions and concerted practices referred to in Article 2 shall be exempt from the prohibition in that Article where their purpose is: - the constitution and operation of groupings of road or inland waterway transport undertakings with a view to carrying on transport activities; - the joint financing or acquisition of transport equipment or supplies, where these operations are directly related to the provision of transport services and are necessary for the joint operations of the aforesaid groupings; always provided that the total carrying capacity of any grouping does not exceed: - 10 000 metric tons in the case of road transport, - 500 000 metric tons in the case of transport by inland waterway. The individual capacity of each undertaking belonging to a grouping shall not exceed 1 000 metric tons in the case of road transport or 50 000 metric tons in the case of transport by inland waterway. 2. If the implementation of any agreement, decision or concerted practice covered by paragraph 1 has, in a given case, effects which are incompatible with the requirements of Article 5 and which constitute an abuse of the exemption from the provisions of Article 2, undertakings or associations of undertakings may be required to make such effects cease. Article 5 Non-applicability of the prohibition The prohibition in Article 2 may be declared inapplicable with retroactive effect to: - any agreement or category of agreement between undertakings, - any decision or category of decision of an association of undertakings, or - any concerted practice or category of concerted practice which contributes towards: - improving the quality of transport services ; or - promoting greater continuity and stability in the satisfaction of transport needs on markets where supply and demand are subject to considerable temporal fluctuation ; or - increasing the productivity of undertakings ; or - furthering technical or economic progress; and at the same time takes fair account of the interests of transport users and neither: (a) imposes on the transport undertakings concerned any restriction not essential to the attainment of the above objectives ; nor (b) makes it possible for such undertakings to eliminate competition in respect of a substantial part of the transport market concerned. Article 6 Agreements intended to reduce disturbances resulting from the structure of the transport market 1. Until such time as the Council, acting in pursuance of the common transport policy, introduces appropriate measures to ensure a stable transport market, the prohibition laid down in Article 2 may be declared inapplicable to any agreement, decision or concerted practice which tends to reduce disturbances on the market in question. 2. A decision not to apply the prohibition laid down in Article 2, made in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14, may not be taken until the Council, either acting by a qualified majority or, where any Member State considers that the conditions set out in Article 75 (3) of the Treaty are satisfied acting unanimously, has found, on the basis of a report by the Commission, that a state of crisis exists in all or part of a transport market. 3. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 2, the prohibition in Article 2 may be declared inapplicable only where: (a) the agreement, decision or concerted practice in question does not impose upon the undertakings concerned any restriction not indispensable to the reduction of disturbances ; and (b) does not make it possible for such undertakings to eliminate competition in respect of a substantial part of the transport market concerned. Article 7 Invalidity of agreements and decisions Any agreement or decision prohibited under the foregoing provisions shall be automatically void. Article 8 Prohibition of abuse of dominant positions Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the common market or in a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market in so far as trade between Member States may be affected thereby. Such abuse may, in particular, consist in: (a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair transport rates or conditions; (b) limiting the supply of transport, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers; (c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; (d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the provision of transport services. Article 9 Public undertakings 1. In the case of public undertakings and undertakings to which Member States grant special or exclusive rights, Member States shall neither enact nor maintain in force any measure contrary to the provisions of the foregoing Articles. 2. Undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic importance shall be subject to the provisions of the foregoing Articles, in so far as the application thereof does not obstruct, in law or in fact, the accomplishment of the particular tasks assigned to them.

"118","31966R0136","Article 1 1. A common organisation of the market in oil seeds, oleaginous fruit, vegetable oils and fats, and oils and fats of fish or marine mammals shall be established. 2. This Regulation shall cover the following products: >PIC FILE= ""T0019179""> >PIC FILE= ""T0019180""> TITLE I Trade Article 2 1. The Common Customs Tariff shall be applied to the products listed in Article 1 (2) (a), (b) and (d). 2. A system of levies shall be applied to imports from third countries of the products listed in Article 1 (2) (c) and (e) and of those referred to in Article 15 (1). Article 3 1. Subject to the provisions of Article 2, the following shall be incompatible with the provisions of this Regulation in intra-Community trade: - the levying of any customs duty or charge having equivalent effect; - the application of any quantitative restriction or measure having equivalent effect; - recourse to Article 44 of the Treaty. 2. In trade with third countries the following shall be incompatible with the provisions of this Regulation: - the levying of any customs duty or charge having equivalent effect, other than those provided for by this Regulation; - the application of any quantitative restriction or measure having equivalent effect, save where derogation therefrom is decided by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission. 3. The restriction of the import or export licences provided for in Article 17 to a specified category of those entitled to receive them shall be one of the measures considered as having effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction. 4. Intra-Community trade in the goods listed in Article 1 (2) shall be incompatible with the provisions of this Regulation where any products not in free circulation are used in their manufacture. 5. Until such time as national arrangements governing suspension or drawback of customs duties, levies or charges on products for re-export to third countries have been harmonised, and without prejudice to the provisions to be adopted in connection with such harmonisation, the Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, shall take the necessary steps to counteract any disturbances on the olive oil market resulting from disparities between these national arrangements. 6. Where the products listed in Article 1 (2) (a) and (b) are imported from third countries in such quantities and under such conditions as might seriously prejudice or threaten to prejudice the interests of Community producers of the products listed in Article 1 (2), a compensatory amount may be charged on imports. A compensatory amount may also be charged on imports of the products listed in Article 1 (2) where, as a result of direct or indirect subsidies or premiums granted in respect of these products by one or more third countries, or as a result of equivalent measures, actual offers of these products do not correspond to the prices which would prevail in the absence of such measures or practices and where such a situation is causing or is threatening to cause serious prejudice to Community production of the products listed in Article 1 (2). The introduction of such compensatory amounts shall respect the international commitments undertaken by the Member States and the Community. The amounts shall be fixed in accordance with rules to be adopted by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission. TITLE II Olive oil Article 4 Before 1 October of each year the Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, shall fix a single production target price, a single market target price, a single intervention price and a single threshold price for olive oil for the Community. Subject to the provisions of Article 9, these prices shall remain in force throughout the following marketing year. The marketing year shall run from 1 November to 31 October. These prices shall relate to a standard quality for oil corresponding to one of the definitions in the Annex referred to in Article 35. This standard quality shall be determined by the Council in accordance with the procedure referred to in the first paragraph. They shall be fixed at the wholesale marketing stage exclusive of taxes. Article 5 The production target price shall be fixed at a level which is fair to producers, account being taken of the need to keep Community production at the required level. Article 6 The market target price shall be fixed at a level which will permit normal marketing of olive oil produced, account being taken of prices for competing products and in particular of the probable trend of these prices during the marketing year and the incidence of the monthly increases referred to in Article 9 on prices for olive oil. Article 7 The intervention price, which guarantees that producers will be able to sell their produce at a price which, allowing for market fluctuations, is as close as possible to the market target price, shall be equal to the market target price reduced by an amount large enough to allow for these fluctuations and for the transport of olive oil from production areas to consumption areas. Article 8 The threshold price shall be fixed in such a way that the selling price for the imported product at the frontier crossing point referred to in Article 13 (2) shall be the same as the market target price. Article 9 To enable sales to be staggered, the market target price, the intervention price and the threshold price shall be increased each month, for a period of ten months beginning 1 January, by an amount which shall be the same for all three prices. The monthly increases, which shall be the same for each month, shall be fixed each year by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, account being taken of average storage costs and interest charges in the Community. Article 10 1. Where the production target price is higher than the market target price ruling at the beginning of the marketing year, a subsidy equal to the difference between these two prices shall be granted to producers of olive oil extracted within the Community from olives harvested within the Community. Only oil to which the provisions of this paragraph have not already been applied shall be eligible for this subsidy. 2. The principles governing the grant of the subsidy provided for in paragraph 1 shall be defined by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission. Acting in accordance with the same procedure, the Council shall adopt measures to ensure that olive oil producers receive this subsidy only in respect of oils which meet the conditions set out in paragraph 1. 3. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38. Article 11 1. In each producer Member State an intervention agency shall, under conditions to be laid down in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5, buy in olive oil of Community origin offered to it at intervention centres in production areas. The intervention agency shall buy at the intervention price and at that price only. If, however, the description or quality of the oil offered to the intervention agency does not correspond to that for which the intervention price was fixed, the buying-in price shall be adjusted by means of a scale of price increases and reductions. Furthermore, if at the request of the intervention agency oil is delivered to a place other than the centre indicated by the seller when the offer is made, the resulting change in transport costs to the seller shall be taken into account when payment is being effected. 2. With a view to stabilising the market during the marketing year, intervention agencies may conclude storage contracts for Community olive oil pursuant to provisions adopted by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission. 3. Olive oil bought in by intervention agencies shall not be sold by them on the Community market on terms which might impede price formation at the level of the market target price. 4. The Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, shall determine the main intervention centres and lay down criteria to be applied when other centres are being determined ; the latter shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38 after consultation with the Member States concerned. 5. Detailed rules for the application of this Article, and in particular those concerning the quality and size of the consignments offered under paragraph 1, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38. Article 12 To mitigate the effects of harvest fluctuations on the balance between supply and demand and in this way to stabilise consumer prices, the Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, may require intervention agencies to form a buffer stock of olive oil. It shall, in accordance with the same procedure, lay down the conditions governing the formation, management and disposal of the buffer stock. Article 13 1. If the threshold price is higher than the c.i.f. price, a levy equal to the difference between these two prices shall be charged on imports of unrefined olive oil from third countries. 2. The c.i.f. price, calculated for a Community frontier crossing point, shall be determined on the basis of the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market. The frontier crossing point shall be fixed by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, account being taken of the extent to which this point is representative for imports. When the most favourable purchasing opportunities are being determined, only those offers which correspond to actual purchasing opportunities for quantities which are representative of the market shall be taken into account. Prices shall be adjusted to allow for any deviations from the description or quality for which the threshold price was fixed. 3. Where free quotations on the world market are not a determining factor for the offer price and where this price is lower than world market prices, a price determined on the basis of the offer price shall be substituted for the c.i.f. price in respect of these imports and these imports only. 4. The levy shall be fixed by the Commission. The criteria for determining the c.i.f. price and the price referred to in paragraph 3 shall be laid down and detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38. Article 14 1. A levy shall be charged on imports of refined olive oil from third countries. This levy shall be composed of a variable component corresponding to the levy applicable to the quantity of olive oil needed for its production (which may be fixed at a standard rate) and a fixed component to protect the processing industry. 2. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission. Article 15 1. On imports from third countries of olives falling within sub-headings Nos 07.01 N and 07.03 A, excluding those for purposes other than the production of oil, a levy derived from the levy applicable to olive oil pursuant to Article 13 and based on the oil content of the imported product shall be charged in addition to the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff. The levy shall be reduced by the amount resulting from application of the customs duty to the value of the imported product. This amount may be fixed at a standard rate. 2. On imports from third countries of the products listed in Article 1 (2) (e) a levy derived from the levy applicable to olive oil and based on the oil content of the imported product shall be charged. However, the levy shall only be charged if commitments undertaken within GATT are respected. 3. Detailed rules for the application of this Article, and in particular those concerning the determination of oil content which may be fixed at a standard rate, shall be adopted by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission. Article 16 The levy applicable to an import shall be that in force on the day of importation. Article 17 1. Imports from third countries of any of the products listed in Article 1 (2) (c), (d) and (e) shall be conditional on the submission of an import licence. Exports of olive oil to third countries shall be conditional on the submission of an export licence. These licences shall be issued on application by the party concerned under rules to be adopted by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission. These rules may require the lodging of a deposit. 2. Import and export licences shall be valid from the date of issue until the end of the third month following the month of issue. 3. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38. Article 18 1. When olive oil is exported to third countries: - the difference between prices within the Community and prices on the world market may be covered by a refund where the former are higher than the latter; - a levy equal at most to the difference between prices on the world market and prices within the Community may be charged where the former are higher than the latter. 2. Provisions for the application of this Article shall be adopted by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission. Article 19 Olive oil used in the manufacture of preserved fish and vegetables shall benefit from a system of production refunds or from full or partial suspension of the import levy. Provisions for the application of this Article shall be adopted by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission. Article 20 1. If the olive oil market in the Community experiences or is threatened with serious disturbances by reason of: - imports from third countries of the products listed in Article 1 (2) (c), (d) and (e), in particular where the intervention agencies have been led to buy in substantial quantities of olive oil under Article 11 (1) ; or - exports of olive oil to third countries, in particular where the market price for olive oil might substantially exceed or threaten to exceed the level of the market target price, or where it has been decided to dispose of the buffer stock, appropriate measures may be applied until such disturbance or threat of disturbance has ceased. 2. The Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure, laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, shall determine the nature of the measures which may be applied and shall adopt provisions for the application of this Article. TITLE III Other vegetable oils and oil seeds produced in the Community Article 21 The oil seeds to which the provisions of Articles 22 to 29 shall apply are: - colza and rape seed, - sunflower seed. The Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, may decide to extend these provisions to other oil seeds. Article 22 1. Each year in time to allow farmers to plan their production, and for the first time in 1966, the Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, shall fix a single target price for each species of oil seed for the Community and a basic intervention price calculated for an intervention centre to be determined in accordance with the same procedure. Subject to the provisions of Article 25, these prices shall remain in force throughout the marketing year beginning in the following calendar year. They shall relate to a standard quality and shall be fixed at the wholesale marketing stage exclusive of taxes. The dates on which each marketing year begins and ends, the date before which the target prices and basic intervention prices must be fixed, and the standard quality for each species of seed shall be determined by the Council acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in the first subparagraph. 2. In good time before the beginning of each marketing year, the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph 1, shall determine the main intervention centres and fix the derived intervention prices applicable in these centres. Acting in accordance with the same procedure, the Council shall lay down criteria for determining other centres and fixing other derived intervention prices. These centres shall be determined and these prices shall be fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38 after consultation with the Member States concerned. Article 23 Target prices shall be fixed at a level which is fair to producers, account being taken of the need to keep Community production at the required level. Article 24 The derived intervention price, which guarantees that producers will be able to sell their produce at a price which, allowing for market fluctuations, is as close as possible to the target price, shall be equal to the target price reduced by an amount large enough to allow for these fluctuations. The derived intervention prices shall be fixed at a level which will allow seeds to move freely within the Community under natural conditions of price formation and in accordance with the needs of the market. Article 25 To enable sales to be staggered, the target price and the intervention price shall be increased each month, for a period of at least five months beginning with the third month of the marketing year, by an amount which shall be the same for both prices. The monthly increases, which shall be the same for each month, shall be fixed each year by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, account being taken of average storage costs and interest charges in the Community. Article 26 1. In each Member State an intervention agency shall, under conditions to be laid down in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, buy in seeds of Community origin offered to it at intervention centres. The intervention agency shall buy at the intervention price and at that price only. If, however, the quality of the seeds offered to the intervention agency does not correspond to that for which the intervention price was fixed, the buying-in price shall be adjusted by means of a scale of price increases and reductions. Furthermore, if at the request of the intervention agency the seeds are delivered to a place other than the centre indicated by the seller when the offer is made, the resulting change in transport costs to the seller shall be taken into account when payment is being effected. 2. The Council, acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, shall lay down: (a) the conditions under which intervention shall take place during the last two months of the marketing year; (b) the principles governing the disposal by intervention agencies of seeds bought in by them. 3.

The subsidies must be granted from the first marketing year in which this Regulation is applied and only to the extent necessary to maintain this price support. Member States shall communicate to the Commission any information concerning the introduction, calculation and granting of these subsidies before they become operative.

"121","31962R0025","Article 1 In order to enable the common organisation of agricultural markets to attain its objectives, a European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (hereinafter called the ""Fund"") is hereby set up. The Fund shall form part of the Community budget. TITLE I Single market stage Article 2 1. Revenue from levies on imports from third countries shall accrue to the Community and shall be used for Community expenditure so that the budget resources of the Community comprise those revenues together with all other revenues decided in accordance with the rules of the Treaty and the contributions of Member States under Article 200 of the Treaty. The Council shall, at the appropriate time, initiate the procedure laid down in Article 201 of the Treaty in order to implement the above-mentioned provisions. 2. Since at the single market stage price systems will be standardised and agricultural policy will be on a Community basis, the financial consequences thereof shall devolve upon the Community. The Fund shall accordingly finance: (a) refunds on exports to third countries; (b) intervention aimed at stabilising markets; (c) common measures adopted in order to attain the objectives set out in Article 39 (1) (a) of the Treaty, including the structural modifications required for the proper working of the common market, provided that those measures do not encroach upon the work of the European Investment Bank and the European Social Fund. TITLE II Transitional period Article 3 1. The following expenditure shall be eligible for aid from the Fund: (a) refunds on exports to third countries calculated, on the basis of the net quantities of exports and the rate of refund in the Member State whose average refund is the lowest, in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations on individual products; (b) intervention on the domestic market the aim and function of which is identical with that of the refunds referred to in subparagraph (a) ; the Council, acting unanimously during the second stage and by a qualified majority thereafter on a proposal from the Commission, shall establish that these are identical; (c) other intervention on the domestic market effected in accordance with Community rules ; the conditions governing the eligibility of the expenditure relating thereto shall be determined by the Council, acting unanimously during the second stage and by a qualified majority thereafter on a proposal from the Commission; (d) action undertaken in accordance with Community rules for attaining the objectives set out in Article 39 (1) (a) of the Treaty including structural changes necessitated by the development of the common market ; the conditions governing the eligibility of the expenditure relating thereto shall be determined by the Council, acting unanimously during the second stage and by a qualified majority thereafter on a proposal from the Commission. 2. The Commission shall submit initial proposals in pursuance of paragraph 1 (b), (c) and (d) not later than 30 September 1962 to enable the Community to finance the transactions referred to in those subparagraphs as from the year 1962/63. 3. From the first year, the Council shall each year, on the basis of a report from the Commission, examine how the Community financing of export refunds provided for in paragraph 1 (a) has affected guidance of production and development of outlets. The Council, acting unanimously during the second stage at the request of one of the Member States or of the Commission, and by a qualified majority thereafter on a proposal from the Commission, may amend the criteria adopted for the Community financing of those refunds. The Council shall also, on the basis of a report from the Commission, examine every year the effect on the common agricultural policy of the Community financing provided for in paragraph 1 (b), (c) and (d). Article 4 Before the end of the third year, the Council shall, on the basis of a report from the Commission, carry out a comprehensive examination of the development of the transactions of the Fund as a whole, the nature of expenditure from the Fund, the conditions governing the eligibility of that expenditure, the apportionment of the revenue of the Fund, and the progress made in implementing the common agricultural policy, and in particular the guidance of agricultural production in Member States, price harmonisation, and the development of intra-Community trade. This examination shall precede the decisions to be taken in pursuance of Articles 5 (1) and 7 (2). Article 5 1. For expenditure eligible under Article 3 (1) (a), (b) and (c), the contribution from the Fund shall, as regards the first three years, be fixed at one-sixth for 1962/63, two-sixths for 1963/64, and three-sixths for 1964/65. From 1 July 1965 and until the end of the transitional period, contributions from the Fund shall increase regularly so that, at the end of the transitional period, all eligible expenditure shall be financed by the Fund. In the light of the results of the comprehensive examination provided for in Article 4, the necessary decision shall be taken by the Council according to the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 of the Treaty. 2. The contribution from the Fund to the expenditure eligible under Article 3 (1) (d) shall, as far as possible, correspond to one third of the amount fixed in pursuance of paragraph 1 of this Article. Article 6 1. The total amount allocated to the Fund to enable it to meet the expenditure defined above shall be fixed every year by the Council in accordance with budgetary procedure. 2. The sums fixed every year may be increased by a decision of the Council acting according to the same procedure. Article 7 1. The revenue of the Fund shall consist, for the first three years, of financial contributions from Member States calculated for the first part according to the scale laid down in Article 200 (1) of the Treaty and for the second part in proportion to net imports from third countries effected by each Member State. The two parts of the contributions from Member States shall constitute the total receipts of the Fund in the following proportions: >PIC FILE= ""T0050803""> 2. Before the end of the third year and in the light of the results of the comprehensive examination provided for in Article 4, the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 200 (3) of the Treaty, and with the aim of ensuring that progressive advance is made towards a single market system, shall draw up rules concerning the revenue of the Fund which shall be valid from 1 July 1965 until the end of the transitional period. Article 8 This Regulation, under the conditions laid down in the Regulations relating to each of the individual products, shall apply to the markets in cereals, pigmeat, eggs and poultrymeat from 1 July 1962, to the market in milk and milk products from 1 November 1962, and where necessary, to other markets from dates to be determined by the Council.

"124","31964R0017","Article 1 agricultural knowledge and towards vocational training; whereas in the same way particular attention should be paid to the social conditions of persons engaged in agriculture ; and whereas when aid is granted from the Fund priority should be given to projects which are part of a comprehensive system of measures to encourage regional economic development so that the best possible use may be made within the framework of the economy as a whole of all the factors affecting structures ; Whereas the returns on agriculture are often inadequate to finance the improvement of agricultural structures, and whereas farmers should be encouraged to increase productivity ; whereas the Fund should therefore make capital aids available to them in the form of a lump sum or in the form of instalments ; Whereas, however, the granting of aid from the Fund must not have the effect of distorting the terms of competition to an extent incompatible with the principles set out in the Treaty ; Whereas , to ensure that the actions of the Community are harmonised with those of Member States, projects to be financed by the Fund should have the approval of the Member State concerned, and that Member State should participate in the 1 . The European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (hereinafter called the 'Fund'), set up under Article 1 of Regulation No 25 on the financing of the common agricultural policy, shall include two sections : the Guarantee Section , the Guidance Section . financing of the projects ; 2 . The Guarantee Section shall include expenditure financed by the Fund relating to refunds on exports to third countries and to intervention on the domestic market. 3 . The Guidance Section shall include expenditure financed by the "" Fund resulting from common measures undertaken in order to attain the objectives set out in Article 39 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Treaty, including structural adjustments made necessary by the development of the common market or required for the proper working thereof. 4 . Expenditure by Member States and by those benefiting from aid from the Fund relating to administrative costs and personnel shall not be borne by the Fund. PART ONE GUARANTEE SECTION Whereas, to ensure that beneficiaries observe the conditions laid down when aid is granted from the Fund, provision should be made for an effective supervision procedure and for the possibility of suspending, reducing or discontinuing such aid ; Whereas the method of calculating the 'net imports ' part of contributions by Member States laid down in Article 7 (1 ) of Regulation No 25 should be defined and it shoul.d be laid down that such calculation should be made , separately for each sector of the common organisation of the markets ; Whereas, to facilitate the general working of the Fund, provision should be made for close co-operation between the Member States and the Commission through a Commitee for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund ; Whereas, with regard to aid from the Fund under the Guarantee Section, the task of delivering Opinions on the main factors in Community financing should be reserved for the Fund Committee , while that of delivering Opinions on certain provisions directly related to the working of the common organisation of markets should be left to the Management Committees for the various products ; Whereas, with regard toi aid from the Fund under the Guidance Section, the Standing. Committee on I. Expenditure relating to refunds on exports to third countries Article 2 1 . The net quantities exported to third countries by each Member State, which shall serve as a basis for calculating the repayment of the refunds on exports to third countries laid down in Article 3 ( 1 ) ( a ) of Regulation No 25 , shall be calculated according to the method known as the 'basic products' method, the derived products being converted into an equivalent quantity of the basic product. Official Journal of the European Communities 105 Detailed rules for the application of this paragraph shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 26. The guarantees offered under the system referred to in (b ) above and the economic effect thereof shall be assessed according to the procedure laid down in Article 7 . Article 3 1 . To determine the rate of refund referred to in Article 3 ( 1 ) (a ) of Regulation No 25 , each Member State shall calculate, once every year, the amount of the average . refund for each basic product for the accounting period of the Guarantee Section within the meaning of Article 4 of the Financial Regulation relating to the Fund . The Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall draw up a list of basic products for each sector of the common organisation of markets . In drawing up that list, the Council shall follow the general rule according to which a 'basic product' means a product on which the import charge is calculated according to criteria relating thereto and not in relation to the import charge on another product. 2 . Derived products shall be converted into their basic product equivalent by the use of the coefficients adopted within the framework of the common organisation of markets . 3 . Standard coefficients may, however, be adopted where : ( a ) provisions relating to the common organisation of markets lay down several coefficients for a derived product, because of the composition or presentation of that derived product ; ( b ) a derived product is obtained from several basic products ; ( c ) products with different characteristics coming under the same heading number of the Common Customs Tariff are obtained from a single basic product ; ( d ) statistics do not make it possible to isolate a product from a group of products . For the 1962/63 and 1963 /64 marketing years , specific coefficients may furthermore be adopted where several derived products are obtained from a single basic product. The list of coefficients referred to in this paragraph shall be decided according to the procedure laid down in Article 7 . 4 . When the net quantities exported by each Member State are calculated, no account shall be taken of : (a ) transactions carried out under a customs system suspending import charges ; (b ) transactions carried out under a system the economic effect of which is similar to that of the system referred to under paragraph 4 ( a ) and which offers equivalent administrative guaran ­ tees : ( c ) transactions carried out free from import charges and without the granting of export refunds, in accordance with a derogation under the provision relating to the common organisation of markets . 2 . Such calculation shall be made for each basic product by dividing the total figure for the refunds granted on that basic product and on the derived products by the figure for the gross quantities of that basic product, and of the derived products converted into equivalent quantities of the basic product, exported to third countries . The gross quantities shall be calculated in accordance with the method laid down in Article 2 (4). However, in respect of the market in beef and veal , frozen meat shall be excluded from the calculation of the lowest average refund . Special provisions shall be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 26 for exports effected under a transitional system set up under the Regulations on the common organisation of markets . 3 . Each Member State shall , within the periods laid down in Article 9 ( 1 ), communicate to the Commission the rate of the average refund on each basic product, the factors involved in the calculation thereof, and the facts required to make any of the corrections provided for in Article 4 (3 ). Article 4 1 . On the basis of the information provided in pursuance of Article 3 (3 ) and after comparison of the annual average refunds granted by individual Member States, the lowest average refunds to be used for the Community as a whole shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 26. 106 Official Journal of the European Communities II . Expenditure relating to intervention on the domestic market Article 5 1 . Interventions on the domestic market the aim and function of which is , within the meaning of Article 3 ( 1 ) (b ) of Regulation No 25 , identical with that of refunds on exports to third countries , shall mean all actions subject to Community rules within the framework of the common organisation of markets which are designed to withdraw from the market those quantities of products which cannot be absorbed by it, provided that appropriate measures are taken to ensure that for the disposal of such products on the domestic market an outlet other than the usual outlet is found, in order to remedy the situation created by the surplus . 2 . For each sector of the common organisation of the markets the Council, acting unanimously during the second stage and by a qualified majority thereafter on a proposal from the Commission, shall determine that the aim and function of such action is identical with that of refunds on exports to third countries and shall lay down detailed rules of application for aid from the Fund . Article 6 In making the comparison referred to above, where appropriate :  average refunds on non-representative quantities, within the meaning of paragraph 2, should be excluded ;  corrections should be made as indicated in paragraph 3 . 2 . 'Non-representative quantities' means gross quantities exported to third countries, calculated in accordance with the method laid down in Article 2 (4), which for each Member State, in respect of each basic product including the derived products converted into their equivalent quantities of the basic product, represent less than 5% of the gross quantities exported to third countries by the Com ­ munity as a whole. The non-representative quantities to be excluded may be reduced to 4% or increased to 6% according to the procedure laid down in Article 26, to take account in particular of the stability or otherwise of the flow of exports of the product in question . Such degree of stability shall be determined by examining the data on exports effected over a period of not less than the two preceding years . 3 . The average refunds granted by each Member State shall be corrected according to the procedure laid down in Article 26 where such refunds are affected by the application of measures taken within the framework of the common organisation of markets and designed to : ( a) derogate from the lower price limit fixed for the Community ; (b ) lower the levies in relation to third countries for a period of over three months ; ( c ) grant production refunds ; (d ) grant for milk products production aids required in order for a target price to be reached . The corrections to be made shall correspond to the incidence of the measures applied by the Member States , and shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions laid down within the framework of the common organisation of markets . Where, for a net exporting Member State ,' the rate of the lowest average refund, corrected as above, is higher than the actual average rate thereof, the latter shall be used in calculating the refund. However, for a net exporting Member State which in accordance with subparagraph 3 (d ) grants production aids within the framework of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products, that actual average rate shall be increased by the incidence of those aids . 1 . Other interventions on the domestic market within the meaning of Article 3 ( 1 ) ( c ) of Regulation No 25 means all actions on the domestic market effected in accordance with Community rules within the framework of the common organisation of markets where the action is obligatory or is designed to avoid, wholly or partially, an obligatory action . In the latter case, the eligible expenditure may not exceed that which would have been eligible in the case of the action which has been avoided . 2 . The Council, acting unanimously during the second stage and by a qualified majority thereafter on a proposal from the Commission, shall determine for each sector of the common organisation of markets the conditions governing the eligibility of the expenditure relating thereto . III .

By way of derogation from the provisions of Article 4 (2) of this Regulation, the installation and use of recording equipment conforming to the provisions of Annexes I and II to this Regulation shall become compulsory only from 1 January 1980 for vehicles fitted with recording equipment of the type permitted under paragraph 1 of this Article. Article 18 CHAPTER VI Final provisibns Article 21 1 . In the event of breakdown or faulty operation of the equipment, the employer shall have it repaired by approved fitters or workshops , at the latest as soon as the vehicle has returned to the premises of the undertaking. If the vehicle is unable to return to the premises within a period of one week counting from the day of the breakdown or of the discovery of defective operation, the repair shall be carried out en route. Measures taken by Member States pursuant to Article 21 may give the competent authorities power to prohibit the use of the vehicle in cases where breakdown or faulty operation has not been put right as provided in the foregoing subparagraphs . 2 . While the equipment is unserviceable or operating defectively, crew members shall mark on the record sheet or sheets , or on a temporary sheet to be attached to the record sheet, all information for the various periods of time which is not recorded correctly by the equipment. 1 . Member States shall , in good time and after consulting the Commission, adopt such laws, regulations or administrative provisions as may be necessary for the implementation of this Regulation . Such measures shall cover, inter alia, the reorganisation of, procedure for, and means of carrying out, checks on compliance and the penalties to be imposed in case of breach. 2 . Member States shall assist each other in applying the provisions of this Regulation and in checking compliance therewith . 3 .

Paragraph 1 shall apply : ( a ) to products covered by intervention arrangements under the common organisation of agricultural markets ; (b ) to products whose price depends on the price of the products referred to under ( a) and which are governed by the common organisation of market or are the subject of a specific arrangement under Article 235 of the Treaty. 258 Official Journal of the European Communities This option shall be exercised only where application of the monetary measures referred to in paragraph 1 . would lead to disturbances in trade in agricultural products . 2 . No compensatory amount shall be fixed for products for which the amount calculated in accordance with Article 2 is negligible in . relation to their average value. Article 2 Article 5 Until the Member States concerned are in a position to charge compensatory amounts on imports , they may make imports of the products referred to in Article 1 dependent on the lodging of a deposit intended to guarantee payment of these amounts . Article 6 1 . The compensatory amounts for the products covered by intervention arrangements shall be equal to the amounts obtained by applying to the prices the percentage difference between :  the parity of the currency of the Member State concerned declared to and recognised by the International Monetary fund, on the one hand, and v  the arithmetic mean of the spot market rates of this currency against the US dollar during a period to be determined. 2. - For the other products referred to, in Article 1 , the compensatory amounts shall be equal to the incidence, on the prices of the product concerned, of the application of the compensatory amount to the prices of the product referred to in paragraph 1 , on which they depend. 3 . However, with regard to trade between one Member State referred to in Article 1 and another Member State referred to in that Article, the compensatory amount applicable to a specified product shall be reduced by the compensatory amount applied to that product in the latter Member State . 1 . Detailed rules for the application of this Regulation, which may include other derogations from the regulations on the common agricultural policy, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 26 of Council Regulation No 120/67/EEC1 of 13 June 1967 on the common organisation of the market in cereals , as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2434/702, or, if appropriate, the corresponding article of the other regulations on the common organisation of agricultural markets . 2.

Official Journal of the European Communities 445 Article 235 . Member States shall take all appropriate measures to prevent and punish any abuse of the arrangements which they may decide to apply pursuant to paragraph 2 . They shall notify the Commission immediately of such measures . 1 . In order to obviate disturbances caused by offers from third countries at abnormal prices , reference prices valid for the whole Community shall be fixed each year. 2. The reference price shall be equal to the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus the amount defined in paragraph 4 . These producer prices shall correspond to the average of the prices recorded during the three years prior to the date for fixing the reference price for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, on the representative market or markets situated in the production ' areas where prices are lowest, for the products or varieties which represent a considerable proportion of production marketed for part of the year or throughout the whole year and which satisfy specified requirements as regards quality and market preparation . The reference price shall be fixed for one year. In order, however, to take seasonal price variations into account, each year may be divided into a number of periods within which prices remain relatively stable. 3 . When the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on the market shall be disregarded . 4. The amount referred to in the first sentence of paragraph 2, which may be calculated at a standard rate, shall be based on marketing costs for products of Community origin, estimated with a view to enabling the reference price and prices of products imported from third countries to be compared at the same marketing stage. TITLE IV Trade with third countries Article 22 1 . Subject to Community provisions to the contrary and to exceptions decided upon by the Council acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2 ) of the Treaty on a proposal from the Commission,  the levying of any charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty,  the application of any quantitative restriction or measure having equivalent effect, on imports from third countries of the products referred to in Article 1 shall be prohibited .

The Council , acting in accordance with the voting procedure laid down in Article 43 (2 ) of the . Treaty on a proposal from the Commission, shall , before 1 January 1973 , decide upon the conditions under which the prohibition contained in the second indent of paragraph 1 shall be extended to the products listed in Annex III during the periods specified therein . Until the entry into force of the measures . decided upon pursuant to the first subparagraph, Member States shall apply no quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect other than those which they applied during the marketing year preceding 1 January 1970; nor shall they make such measures more restrictive . Member States which fulfil the conditions laid down for applying the measures referred to in the second subparagraph, and which propose to apply them, shall notify the Commission thereof before the beginning of the import year. Article 24 1 . The Commission shall , on the basis of information supplied by Member States or data gathered by the Commission itself, regularly follow the trend of average prices for products imported from third countries on the most representative import markets of the Member States, for a product with defined commercial characteristics, for each exporting country . 2 . For each product subject to a reference price, an entry price shall be calculated each market day for each exporting country on the basis of prices recorded at, or converted to, the import/wholesale stage for a product of the quality class by reference to which the reference price is fixed or, where the conditions below are fulfilled, for a product marketed in a lower quality class . 446 Official Journal of the European Communities recorded for the other exporting country or countries concerned . Where the same charge is applied in respect of a number of exporting countries, the amount of the charge shall be equal to the difference between the reference price and the arithmetic mean of the average entry prices calculated for each exporting country concerned, in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph. 3 . The countervailing charge, which shall be the same for all Member States, shall be levied in addition to the customs duties in force . Article 26 Where the only prices available in respect of a given exporting country on a representative import market relate to products marketed in a quality class lower than that by reference to which the reference price is fixed , such prices shall be :  multiplied by a conversion factor if, by reason of production conditions in the exporting country concerned, such products have not because of their quality been normally or traditionally marketed in the quality class by reference to which the reference price is fixed,  used as they stand in calculating the entry price if the condition stated in the first indent is not fulfilled . 3 . The entry price for a given exporting country shall be equal to the lowest price or to the arithmetic mean of the lowest prices recorded for at least 30% of the quantities from the exporting country concerned which are marketed on all representative markets for which prices are available, such price or prices being multiplied where appropriate by the conversion factor, following deduction of :  the customs duties in the Common Customs Tariff, ' any countervailing charges,  other import charges the incidence of which is included in the prices,  the cost of transporting the products from Community frontier-crossing points to the representative import markets on which prices are recorded . 1 . Once introduced, the charge shall not be altered so long as the conditions on import markets which justified its introduction have not so changed as to :  make the amount of the charge inadequate,  necessitate the regrouping of exporting countries . 2 . A decision to withdraw the charge for an exporting country shall be taken when the entry price has been at least equal to the reference price for two consecutive market days . This decision shall also be taken if there are no prices in respect of that country for five consecutive market days . Article 27 1 . The following shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 33 :  detailed rules for the application of Articles 23 to 26, in particular the criteria to be adopted for altering the charges in force, Article 25  the conversion factors ,  the reference prices . 2 . A decision to introduce, alter or withdraw the charge shall be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 33 . However, between regular meetings of the Management Committee, these measures shall be adopted by the Commission . In that event they shall be valid until such time as any measures adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 33 enter into force. 1 . If the entry price of a product imported from a third country remains at least 0*50 units of account below the reference price for two consecutive market days, a countervailing charge shall be introduced in respect of the exporting country concerned, save in exceptional circumstances . This charge shall be equal to the difference between the reference price and the arithmetic mean of the last two entry prices available for that exporting country (hereinafter called the 'average entry price'). This average entry price shall then be calculated each market day for each exporting country until , in respect of that exporting country, the charge is withdrawn. 2 . Where it would be appropriate under the foregoing provisions to apply a countervailing charge in respect of a number of exporting countries for the same product and the same period, a single charge shall be applied in respect of those countries unless the entry prices for one or more of those countries are abnormally low in relation to entry prices Article 28 Where duties on products covered by this Regulation are bound in GATT, the Community shall ensure that the countervailing charge is levied in such a way \ Official Journal of the European Communities 447 that the commitments undertaken by the Member States and the Community within GATT are respected . Where the application of such a charge results in action within GATT by other contracting parties , the Council shall, on the basis of a proposal or a recommendation from the Commission made in the light of the situation thus created, decide on the steps to be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 113 of the Treaty. It shall, in particular, be for the Council to take any decision to unbind customs duties . 2 . The refund shall be the same for the whole Community . It may be varied according to use or destination . The refund shall be granted on application. 3 .

The State aids to be taken into consideration in this connection shall be grants, interest rebates, or their equivalent where loans at reduced rates of interest are concerned , whether these aids are linked to the investment or to the number of jobs created . The aid equivalent will be calculated in accordance with an implementing Regulation referred to in Article 17 . The aid granted in the form of rent rebates or exemptions from payments of rents of factories may also be taken into account, provided that this form of calculation can be applied . The contribution from the Fund thus defined may, pursuant to a prior decision of the Member State concerned communicated at the same time as the request for this contribution , either supple ­ ment aid granted to the relevant investment by public, authorities or remain credited to those authorities and considered as a partial repayment of such aid .

It shall be calculated for Rotterdam for the same standard quality as the target price . (b ) The threshold price for long grain husked rice shall be calculated by adjusting the threshold price for round grain husked rice by a corrective amount representing the difference in value between the variety of round grain rice corresponding to the standard quality and a variety of long grain rice representative of Community production. Article 13 1 . The levy to be charged shall be that applicable on the day of importation . 2 . However, as regards imports of rice and broken rice, the levy applicable on the day on which appli ­ cation for a licence is lodged, adjusted by reference to the threshold price which will be in force during the month of importation, shall be applied to an import to be effected during the period of validity of the licence, if the applicant so requests when applying for the licence .

The Council , acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall fix the threshold price for round grain husked rice and the protective amount mentioned in paragraph 3 . 5 . The following shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 27 : ( a ) the variety of long grain rice representative of Community production and the difference in value, per metric ton of husked rice, between that variety and the variety of round grain rice corresponding to the standard quality ; (b ) the threshold price for long grain husked rice ; ( c ) the threshold price for round grain wholly milled rice ; (d ) the threshold price for long grain wholly milled rice. v (d ) a cif price for long grain wholly milled rice ; ( e ) a cif price for broken rice. 2 . The cif prices shall be calculated for goods in bulk on the basis of the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market, taking into account, for each of the types of rice referred to in paragraph 1 , the quotations or prices on that market adjusted by reference to any differences in quality compared with the standard quality, and for long grain rice, to any difference in value between that quality and the variety representative of Community production, and where appropriate, adjusted by reference to the conversion rate, processing costs and the value of by-products . 3 . Differences in quality shall be expressed by means of corrective amounts representing the differences in quality and in value between the variety taken as the standard quality and other varieties . 4 . Where free quotations on the world market are not a determining factor for the offer price and where that price is lower than world market prices, a special cif price calculated on the basis of the offer price shall be substituted, solely in respect of the imports in question, for the cif price. 5 .

Minor differences in appearance shall not preclude goods otherwise conforming to the defini ­ tion from being regarded as identical ; (d) 'similar goods' means goods produced in the same country which, although not alike in all respects, have like characteristics and like component mate ­ rials which enable them to perform the same func ­ tions and to be commercially interchangeable ; the quality of the goods, their reputation and the exist ­ ence of a trademark are among the factors to be considered in determining whether goods are similar ; (e) 'identical goods' and 'similar goods', as the case may be, do not include goods which incorporate or reflect engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches for which no adjustment has been made under Article 8 ( 1 ) (b) (iv) because such elements were undertaken in the Community ; (f) 'goods of the same class or kind' means goods which fall within a group or range of goods produced by a particular industry or industry sector, and includes identical or similar goods ; (g) 'the material time for valuation for customs purposes' means : (i) for goods declared for direct entry into free circulation, the date of acceptance by the customs authorities of the declarant's state ­ ment of his intention that the goods should enter into free circulation, (ii) for goods which, after another customs proce ­ dure has been applied, enter into- free circula ­ tion, the time fixed by acts of the Council or the Commission pertaining to that customs procedure or by Member States in accordance with such acts ; (h) 'the Agreement' means the Agreement on imple ­ mentation of Article VII of the General Agree ­ Article 2 1 . The customs value of imported goods is to be determined under Article 3 whenever the conditions prescribed therein are fulfilled . 2 . Where such value cannot be determined under Article 3, it is to be determined by proceeding sequen ­ tially through Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 to the first such Article under which it can be determined, subject to the proviso that the order of application of Articles 6 and 7 shall be reversed if the importer so requests ; it is only when such value cannot be determined under a particular Article that the provisions of the next Article in a sequence established by virtue of this para ­ graph can be applied. 3 .

(a) In determining whether the transaction value is acceptable for the purposes of paragraph 1 , the fact that the buyer and the seller are related within the meaning of Article 1 shall not in itself be grounds for regarding the transaction value as unacceptable . Where necessary, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted provided that the relationship did not influence the price. If, in the light of informa ­ tion provided by the importer or otherwise, the customs administration has grounds for consid ­ ering that the relationship influenced the price, it shall communicate its grounds to the importer and he shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond . If the importer so requests, the communication of the grounds shall be in writing. (b) In a sale between related persons, the transac ­ tion value shall be accepted and the goods valued in accordance with paragraph 1 whenever the importer demonstrates that such value closely approximates to one of the following occurring at or about the same time : (i) the transaction value in sales, between buyers and sellers who are not related in any particular case, of identical or similar goods for export to the Community ; (ii) the customs value of identical or similar goods, as determined under Article 6 ; (iii) the customs value of identical or similar goods, as determined under Article 7 ; (iv) the transaction value in sales, between buyers and sellers who are not related in any particular case, for export to the Community of goods which would be iden ­ tical to the imported goods except for having a different country of production provided that the sellers in any two transac ­ tions being compared are not related . In applying the foregoing tests , due account shall be taken of demonstrated differences in commercial levels, quantity levels, the elements enumerated in Article 8 and costs incurred by the seller in sales in which he and the buyer are not related that are not incurred by the ' seller in sales in which he and the buyer are related . (c) The tests set forth in paragraph 2 (b) are to be used at the initiative of the importer and only for comparison purposes. Substitute values may not be established under the said paragraph 2 (*&gt;) ¢ 3 . (a) The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the buyer to or for the benefit of the seller for the imported goods.

(b) Activities, including marketing activities, under ­ taken by the buyer on his own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in Article 8, are not considered to be an indi ­ rect payment to the seller, even though they might be regarded as of benefit to the seller or have been undertaken by agreement with the seller, and their cost shall not be added to the price actually paid or payable in determining the customs value of imported goods. 4.

(b) In applying this Article, the transaction value of similar goods in a sale at the same commer ­ cial level and in substantially the same quantity as the goods being valued shall be used to determine the customs value . Where no such sale is found, the transaction value of similar goods sold at a different commercial level and/or in different quantities, adjusted to take account of differences attributable to commer ­ cial level and/or to quantity, shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of demonstrated evidence which clearly establishes the reasonableness and accu ­ racy of the adjustment, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a decrease in the value . 1 .

Article 6 1 . (a) If the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are sold in the Community in the condition as imported, the customs value of imported goods, determined under this Article, shall be based on the unit price at which the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are so sold in the greatest aggregate quan ­ tity, at or about the time of the importation of the goods being valued, to persons who are not related to the persons from whom they buy such goods, subject to deductions for the following : (i) either the commissions usually paid or agreed to be paid or the additions usually made for profit and general expenses (including the direct and indirect costs of marketing the goods in question) in connection with sales in the Community of imported goods of the same class or kind ; (ii) the usual costs of transport and insurance and associated costs incurred within the Community ; and (iii) the customs duties and other taxes payable in the Community by reason of the impor ­ tation or sale of the goods. (b) If neither the imported goods nor identical nor similar imported goods are sold at or about the time of importation of the goods being valued, the customs value of imported goods determined under this Article shall , subject otherwise to the provisions of para ­ graph 1 (a), be based on the unit price at which the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are sold in the Community in the condition as imported at the earliest date after the importation of goods being valued but before the expiration of 90 days after such importation . 2 . If neither the imported goods nor identical nor similar imported goods are sold in the Community in Article 7 1 .

Importation into the Community of the products referred to in paragraph 1 shall be free, and therefore not subject to any quantitative restriction, without prejudice to  measures which may be taken under Title V,  measures maintained under Title VI ,  quantitative restrictions for the products listed in Annex I and maintained in the Member States indicated opposite these products in that Annex . procedure while still allowing the Commission and the Member States to introduce appropriate measures in urgent cases ; Whereas to this end more detailed provisions should be introduced on the opening of investigations , on the checks and inspections required, on the hearing of those concerned , the treatment of information^ obtained and the criteria for assessing injury ; Whereas the provisions on the investigations introduced by this Regulation do not prejudice Community or national rules concerning professional secrecy; Whereas , furthermore, in a desire for simplicity and greater transparency of import arrangements , it seemed preferable to draw up a list of quantitative restrictions still applicable at national level rather than a common liberalization list ; Whereas a procedure should be available for application where import restrictions maintained by certain Member States are amended ; whereas in order to prevent these autonomous amendments from constituting obstacles to the implementation of the common commercial policy and from injuring the interests of the Community or one of its Member States , these amendments should be subject to prior consultation and , where necessary, to an auth ­ orization procedure ; Whereas , in addition, the provisions of the Agreement on import licencing procedures signed within the framework of GATT should be transposed into Community law, in particular so as to ensure a greater transparency of the systems of restrictions applied by the Member States ; Whereas the Regulation thus amended should be published in its entirety, Article 2 The Council may, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission , decide to delete certain products from Annex I , if it considers that such action is not liable to create a situation where the reintroduction of protective measures would be justified . TITLE II Community information and consultation procedure Article 3 The Commission shall be informed by the Member States should trends in imports appear to call for surveillance or protective measures . This information shall contain the available evidence on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 9 . The Commission shall pass on this information to all the Member States forthwith .

Article 5 endeavour to check this information with importers , traders , agents , producers , trade associations and organizations . The Commission shall be assisted in this task by staff of the Member State on whose territory these checks are being carried out, provided this Member State so wishes . 3 . The Member States shall supply the Commission, at its request and following procedures laid down by it , with all information at their disposal on developments in the market of the product being investigated . 4 . The Commission may hear the interested natural and legal persons . Such parties must be heard where they have applied in writing within the period laid down in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, showing that they are actually likely to be affected by the outcome of the investigations and that there are special reasons for them to be heard orally. 5 . Where the information requested by the Commission is not supplied within a reasonable period , or the investigation is significantly impeded, findings may be made on the basis of the facts available . 1 . Consultation shall take place within an advisory committee (hereinafter called ' the Committee') which shall consist of representatives of each Member State with a representative of the Commission as chairman . 2 . The Committee shall meet when convened by its chairman . He shall provide the Member States , as promptly as possible , with all relevant information . 3 . Consultation shall cover in particular : (a) terms and conditions of importation , import trends , and the various aspects of the economic and commercial situation as regards the product in question ; (b) the measures , if any, to be taken . 4 . Consultations may be in writing if necessary. The Commission shall in this event inform the Member States , which may express their opinion or request oral consultations within a period of five to eight working days to be decided by the Commission . Article 7 TITLE III Community investigation procedure Article 6 1 . At the end of the investigation , the Commission shall submit a report on the results to the Committee . 2 . If the Commission considers that no Community surveillance or protective measures are necessary , it shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities, after consulting the Committee, a notice that the investigations are closed , stating the main conclusions of the investigations . 3 . If the Commission considers that Community surveillance or protective measures are necessary, it shall take the necessary decisions in accordance with Titles IV and V. 4 . The provisions of this Title shall not preclude the taking, at any time, of surveillance measures in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 or, in an emergency, protective measures in accordance with Articles 15 to 17 . In the latter case , the Commission shall immediately take the investigation measures it considers to be still necessary. The results of the investigation shall be used to re-examine the measures taken . 1 . Where, after consultation it is apparent to the Commission that there is sufficient evidence to justify an investigation , the Commission shall : (a) announce the opening of an investigation in the Official Journal of the European Communities; such announcements shall give a summary of the information received, and stipulate that all relevant information is to be communicated to the Commission ; it shall state the period within which interested parties may make known their views in writing ; (b) commence the investigation, acting in cooperation with the Member States . 2 . The Commission shall seek all information it deems to be necessary and, where it considers it appropriate , after consulting the Committee, No L 35/4 Official Journal of the European Communities 9 . 2 . 82 Article 8 products as indicated by trends in certain economic factors such as :  production,  utilization of capacity,  stocks,  sales ,  market share,  prices (i.e. depression of prices or prevention of price increases which would normally have occurred),  profits ,  return on capital employed,  cash flow,  employment. ' 1 . Information received in pursuance of this Regu ­ lation shall be used only for the purpose for which it was requested .  2 . ( a)&gt; Neither the Council , nor the Commission, nor Member States , nor the officials of any of these , shall reveal any information of a ' confidential nature received in pursuance of this Regulation , or any information provided on a confidential basis , without specific permission from the supplier of such infor ­ mation . . (b) Each request for confidentiality shall state the reasons why the information is confidential . However, if it appears that a request for confidentiality is unjustified and if the supplier of the information wishes neither to make it public nor to authorize its disclosure in general terms or in the form of a summary, the infor ­ mation concerned may be disregarded . 3 . Information will in any case be considered to be confidential if its disclosure is likely to have a significantly adverse effect upon the supplier or the source of such information . 4 . The above paragraphs shall not preclude reference by the Community authorities to general information and in particular to reasons on which decisions taken in pursuance of this Regulation are , based . These authorities must, however, take into account the legitimate interest of the legal and natural persons concerned that their business secrets should nos be divulged . 2 . Where a , threat of serious injury is alleged the Commission shall also examine whether it is clearly foreseeable that a particular situation is likely to develop into actual injury. In this regard account may be taken of factors such as : (a) rate of increase of the exports to the Community ; (b) export capacity in the country of origin or export, already in existence or which will be operational in the foreseeable future, and the likelihood that - the resulting exports will be to the Community. TITLE IV Surveillance Article 9 Article 10 1 . The examination of the trend of imports, of the conditions in which they take place and of the sub ­ stantial injury or threat of substantial injury to Community producers resulting from such imports , shall cover in particular the following factors : (a) the volume . of imports , in particular where there has been a significant increase , either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the Community; (b) the prices of the imports, in particular where there has been a significant price undercutting as compared with the price of a like product in the Community ; (c) the consequent impact on the Community producers of similar or directly competitive 1 . Where developments on the market in respect of a product originating in a third country covered by this Regulation threaten to cause injury to Community producers of like or directly competing products and where the interests of the Community so require, importation of that product may be made subject, as the case may be, to : (a) retrospective Community surveillance carried out according to the procedures laid down in the Decision referred to in paragraph 2, or (b) prior Community surveillance carried out according to the procedures laid down in Article 11 . 9 . 2 . 82 Official Journal of the European Communities No L 35/5 In these cases the product together with the indication 'EUR' shall be entered in Annex II. 2 . Where the decision to impose surveillance is taken simultaneously with the liberalization of impor ­ tation of the product in question, that decision shall be taken by the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission . In all other cases it shall be taken by the Commission and Article 15 (5) shall apply. 3 . The surveillance measures shall be of limited duration . Unless otherwise provided, they shall cease to be valid at the end of the second half calendar year following that in which they were introduced. 3 . Paragraph 2 shall not preclude the putting into free circulation of the product in question if the unit price at which the transaction is effected exceeds that indicated in the import document, or if the total value or quantity of the products to be imported exceeds the value or quantity given in the import document by less than 5 % . The Commission, having heard the opinions expressed in the Committee and taking account of the nature of the products and other special features of the transactions concerned, may fix a different percentage, which, however, should not normally exceed 10 % . 4 . Import documents may be used only for such time as arrangements for the liberalization of imports remain in force in respect of the transactions concerned and in any event not beyond the expiry of a period laid down, with regard to the nature of the products ¢ and other special features of the transactions, at the same time and by means of the same procedure as the imposition of surveillance . 5 . Where the decision taken under Article 10 so requires, the origin of products under Community surveillance must be proved by a certificate of origin . This paragraph shall not prejudice other provisions concerning the production of any such certificate . 6 . Where the product under prior Community surveillance is not liberalized in a Member State, the import authorization granted by that Member State may replace the import document. Article 11 1 .

Import documents may be used only for such time as arrangements for the liberalization of imports remain in force in respect of the transactions concerned . Article 14 and/or on such terms or conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, substantial injury to Community producers of like or directly competing products , and where a critical situation, in which any delay would cause injury which it would be difficult to remedy, calls for immediate intervention in order to safeguard the interests of the Community, the Commission may, acting at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative : (a) limit the period of validity of import documents within the meaning of Article 11 to be issued or endorsed after the entiy into force of this measure ; (b) alter the import rules for the product in question by providing that it may be put into free circu ­ lation only on production of an import authori ­ zation, the granting of which shall be governed by such provisions and subject to such limits as the Commission shall lay down pending action, if any, by the Council under Article 16 . The measures referred to in (a) and (b) shall take effect immediately. 2 . , Where the establishment of a quota constitutes a withdrawal of liberalization, account shall be taken in particular of :  the desirability of maintaining, as far as possible , traditional trade flows,  the volume of goods exported under contracts concluded on normal terms and conditions before the entry into force of a protective measure within the meaning of this Title, where such contracts have been notified to the Commission by the Member State concerned,  the need to avoid jeopardizing achievement of the aim pursued in establishing the quota. 3 . (a) The measures referred to in this Article shall apply to every product which is put into free circulation after their entry into force . They may be limited to imports intended for certain regions of the Community. (b) However, such measures shall not prevent the putting into free circulation of products already on their way to the Community provided that the destination of such products cannot be changed and that those products which, under Articles 10 and 11 may be put into free circulation only on production of an import document are in fact accompanied by such a document. 1 .

The Commission shall be notified by telex of the measures immediately following their adoption . 4 . The notification shall be equivalent to a request within the meaning of Article 15 (4). The measures shall operate only until the coming into operation of the decision taken by the Commission . However, where the Commission decides not to introduce any measure or adopts measures pursuant to Article 15 , different from those tak^n by the Member State, its decision shall apply as from the sixth day following its entry into force, unless the Member State which has taken the measures refers the decision to the Council ; in that case, the national measures shall continue to operate until the entry into force of the decision taken by the Council and for the maximum of one month following referral of the matter to the latter. The Council shall take a decision before the expiry of that period .

( A ) THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE EXPORT PRICE AND THE DOMESTIC PRICE IN THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OR THE EXPORTING COUNTRY OR , IF APPLICABLE , THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT WHEN SOLD TO A THIRD COUNTRY , OR THE COST OF PRODUCTION REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH 2 , SHALL BE BASED ON THE PRICES RULING AT THE SAME LEVEL OF TRADE , NORMALLY AT THE EX-FACTORY LEVEL , AND IN RESPECT OF SALES MADE AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE AT THE SAME TIME . ( B ) DUE ALLOWANCE SHALL BE MADE IN EACH CASE , ON ITS MERITS , FOR THE DIFFERENCES IN CONDITIONS AND TERMS OF SALE , FOR THE DIFFERENCES IN TAXATION , AND FOR THE OTHER DIFFERENCES AFFECTING PRICE COMPARABILITY . IN THE CASES REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH 3 , ALLOWANCE FOR COSTS INCURRED BETWEEN IMPORTATION AND RESALE , AND FOR PROFITS ACCRUING , SHOULD ALSO BE MADE . 5 . NO PRODUCT SHALL BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN DUMPED BY REASON OF THE EXEMPTION OF SUCH PRODUCT FROM DUTIES OR TAXES BORNE BY THE LIKE PRODUCT WHEN DESTINED FOR CONSUMPTION IN THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OR EXPORTATION , OR BY REASON OF THE REFUND OF SUCH DUTIES OR TAXES . 6 . IN THE CASE OF IMPORTS FROM COUNTRIES WHERE TRADE IS ON A BASIS OF NEAR OR TOTAL MONOPOLY AND WHERE DOMESTIC PRICES ARE FIXED BY THE STATE , ACCOUNT MAY BE TAKEN OF THE FACT THAT AN EXACT COMPARISON BETWEEN THE EXPORT PRICE OF A PRODUCT TO THE COMMUNITY AND THE DOMESTIC PRICES IN THAT COUNTRY MAY NOT ALWAYS BE APPROPRIATE , SINCE IN SUCH CASES SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES MAY ARISE IN DETERMINING THE COMPARABILITY OF PRICES . 7 . "" MARGIN OF DUMPING "" MEANS THE PRICE DIFFERENCE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS . ARTICLE 4 1 . ( A ) A DETERMINATION OF INJURY SHALL BE MADE ONLY WHEN THE DUMPED IMPORTS ARE DEMONSTRABLY THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF SUCH INJURY . FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING WHETHER INJURY EXISTS , THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DUMPING POSITIVELY FOUND TO BE AS SUCH SHALL BE WEIGHED AGAINST ALL OTHER FACTORS TAKEN TOGETHER WHICH MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE COMMUNITY INDUSTRY IN QUESTION . ( B ) A DETERMINATION OF THREAT OF INJURY SHALL BE BASED ON FACTS AND NOT MERELY ON ALLEGATION , CONJECTURE OR REMOTE POSSIBILITY . THE CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD CREATE A SITUATION IN WHICH DUMPING WOULD CAUSE INJURY MUST BE CLEARLY FORESEEN AND IMMINENT . 2 . THE EVALUATION OF INJURY SHALL BE BASED ON EXAMINATION OF ALL FACTORS HAVING A BEARING ON THE STATE OF THE INDUSTRY IN QUESTION , SUCH AS ; DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS WITH REGARD TO TURNOVER , MARKET SHARE , PROFITS , PRICES ( INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE DELIVERED , DUTY-PAID PRICE IS LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE COMPARABLE PRICE OF THE LIKE PRODUCT PREVAILING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF TRADE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY ) , EXPORT PERFORMANCE , EMPLOYMENT , VOLUME OF DUMPED AND OTHER IMPORTS , UTILISATION OF CAPACITY OF COMMUNITY INDUSTRY , PRODUCTIVITY ; AND RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES . NO ONE OR SEVERAL OF THESE FACTORS CAN NECESSARILY GIVE DECISIVE GUIDANCE . 3 . IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH WHETHER DUMPED IMPORTS ARE CAUSING INJURY , ALL OTHER FACTORS WHICH INDIVIDUALLY OR IN COMBINATION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE COMMUNITY INDUSTRY SHALL BE EXAMINED . THE FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED ARE , AMONG OTHERS : THE VOLUME AND PRICES OF UNDUMPED IMPORTS OF THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION , COMPETITION BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY PRODUCERS THEMSELVES , CONTRACTION IN DEMAND DUE TO SUBSTITUTION OF OTHER PRODUCTS OR TO CHANGES IN CONSUMER TASTES . 4 . THE EFFECT OF THE DUMPED IMPORTS SHALL BE ASSESSED IN RELATION TO THE COMMUNITY PRODUCTION OF THE LIKE PRODUCT WHEN AVAILABLE DATA PERMIT THE SEPARATE IDENTIFICATION OF PRODUCTION ON THE BASIS OF SUCH CRITERIA AS : THE PRODUCTION PROCESS , THE PRODUCERS' REALISATIONS AND PROFITS . WHEN THE COMMUNITY PRODUCTION OF THE LIKE PRODUCT HAS NO SEPARATE IDENTITY IN THESE TERMS THE EFFECT OF THE DUMPED IMPORTS SHALL BE ASSESSED BY THE EXAMINATION OF THE PRODUCTION OF THE NARROWEST GROUP OR RANGE OF PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDES THE LIKE PRODUCT FOR WHICH THE NECESSARY INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED . 5 . ( A ) FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS REGULATION , THE TERM "" COMMUNITY INDUSTRY "" SHALL BE INTERPRETED AS REFERRING TO THE COMMUNITY PRODUCERS AS A WHOLE OF THE LIKE PRODUCTS OR TO THOSE OF THEM WHOSE COLLECTIVE OUTPUT OF THE PRODUCTS CONSTITUTES A MAJOR PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL COMMUNITY PRODUCTION OF THOSE PRODUCTS EXCEPT THAT : _ WHEN PRODUCERS ARE ALSO IMPORTERS OF THE ALLEGEDLY DUMPED PRODUCT THE TERM "" COMMUNITY INDUSTRY "" MAY BE INTERPRETED AS REFERRING ONLY TO THE REST OF THE PRODUCERS ; _ IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMMUNITY MAY , FOR THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION , BE DIVIDED INTO TWO OR MORE COMPETITIVE MARKETS AND THE PRODUCERS WITHIN EACH MARKET REGARDED AS A COMMUNITY INDUSTRY , IF , BECAUSE OF TRANSPORT COSTS , ALL THE PRODUCERS WITHIN SUCH A MARKET SELL ALL OR ALMOST ALL THEIR PRODUCTION OF THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION IN THAT MARKET AND NONE , OR ALMOST NONE , OF THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION PRODUCED ELSEWHERE IN THE COMMUNITY IS SOLD IN THAT MARKET OR IF THERE EXIST SPECIAL REGIONAL MARKETING CONDITIONS WHICH RESULT IN AN EQUAL DEGREE OF ISOLATION OF THE PRODUCERS IN SUCH A MARKET FROM THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY , PROVIDED , HOWEVER , THAT INJURY MAY BE FOUND IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES ONLY IF THERE IS INJURY TO ALL OR ALMOST ALL OF THE TOTAL PRODUCTION OF THE PRODUCT IN THE MARKET AS DEFINED . ( B ) THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 4 SHALL BE APPLICABLE TO THIS PARAGRAPH . ARTICLE 5 FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS REGULATION , THE TERM "" LIKE PRODUCT "" SHALL BE INTERPRETED TO MEAN A PRODUCT WHICH IS IDENTICAL , I.E . ALIKE IN ALL RESPECTS , TO THE PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION , OR IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH PRODUCT , ANOTHER PRODUCT WHICH HAS CHARACTERISTICS CLOSELY RESEMBLING THOSE OF THE PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION . ARTICLE 6 1 . ANY NATURAL OR LEGAL PERSON , OR ANY ASSOCIATION NOT HAVING LEGAL PERSONALITY , ACTING ON BEHALF OF A COMMUNITY INDUSTRY WHICH CONSIDERS ITSELF INJURED OR THREATENED BY DUMPING MAY LODGE A COMPLAINT , WHICH SHALL FULFIL THE CONDITIONS SET OUT BELOW .

ARTICLE 8 1 . WHERE A MEMBER STATE IS SATISFIED THAT A COMPLAINT CONTAINS THE PARTICULARS SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 7 , IT SHALL AT ONCE INFORM THE COMMISSION AND SHALL FORWARD TO THE COMMISSION ANY OTHER INFORMATION WHICH IT CONSIDERS NECESSARY FOR AN EXAMINATION OF THE MATTER AT COMMUNITY LEVEL . 2 . WHERE , IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY COMPLAINT , A MEMBER STATE IS IN POSSESSION OF SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE BOTH OF DUMPING AND OF INJURY RESULTING THEREFROM FOR A COMMUNITY INDUSTRY , IT SHALL IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATE SUCH EVIDENCE TO THE COMMISSION . 3 . THE COMMISSION SHALL IN EITHER CASE FORWARD THE INFORMATION RECEIVED TO THE OTHER MEMBER STATES FORTHWITH . ARTICLE 9 WHERE A MEMBER STATE FINDS THAT THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT CONTAIN THE PARTICULARS SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 7 OR THAT THE MARGIN OF DUMPING , THE VOLUME OF DUMPED IMPORTS , ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL , OR THE INJURY IS NEGLIGIBLE , IT SHALL SO INFORM THE COMMISSION . THE LATTER SHALL IMMEDIATELY ADVISE THE OTHER MEMBER STATES . IF , WITHIN A PERIOD OF TEN WORKING DAYS FROM THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMMISSION WAS INFORMED , THE LATTER HAS NOT RAISED ANY OBJECTION , WHETHER AT THE REQUEST OF A MEMBER STATE OR ON ITS OWN INITIATIVE , THE COMPLAINT SHALL BE REJECTED FORTHWITH BY THE MEMBER STATE TO WHOM IT WAS SENT , OR BY THE COMMISSION IF THE COMPLAINT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION UNDER ARTICLE 6 ( 2 ) ( B ) ; IN ALL OTHER CASES ARTICLE 10 ( 1 ) SHALL APPLY .

THE COMMISSION SHALL , FUTHERMORE , GIVE THE PARTIES DIRECTLY INTERESTED WHO HAVE SO REQUESTED IN WRITING AND CAN SHOW A SUFFICIENT INTEREST AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ORALLY . ( B ) FURTHERMORE , THE COMMISSION SHALL , ON REQUEST , GIVE THE PARTIES DIRECTLY CONCERNED AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET , SO THAT OPPOSING VIEWS MAY BE PRESENTED AND ANY REBUTTAL ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD . IN PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY THE COMMISSION SHALL TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE NEED TO PRESERVE CONFIDENTIALITY AND OF THE CONVENIENCE OF THE PARTIES .
